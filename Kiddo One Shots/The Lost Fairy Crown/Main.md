The Fairy Queen has lost her crown, and without it, the Enchanted Forest is starting to lose its magic. Flowers are wilting, rivers are slowing, and animals are becoming less talkative. The Fairy Queen summons the players to her court and asks for their help in finding her lost crown. She believes it was taken by the mischievous goblin, Giggles, who loves playing tricks and hiding things.

## Intro

Once upon a time, there was an Enchanted Forest in the center of the Fairy Kingdom. This forest was like no other in the world. The trees were the tallest trees you have ever seen before, with some being so tall the tree tops are above the clouds. The flowers in the forest were colorful and vibrant. The animals, such as the rabbits and owls received magical blessings from the Fairy Queen that let them talk to people. You've even heard rumors from travelers that in some areas, even the plants would talk!

You are two brave adventurers who have lived in the Enchanted Forest for your entire lives. You are known for having done good deeds for all those who live within the Enchanted Forest, so when there is a problem, you are the first people that are called to help.

One day, you are on a walk through the Enchanted Forest, enjoying the sights and smells of the newly bloomed flowers, when you start to notice some of the flowers are less colorful than they usually are. As you continue to walk down the path towards the Fairy Queen's Castle, you see more and more flowers that have lost their color, some are even starting to wilt. Up ahead you see an old friend of yours, Chippy the Squirrel. You continue walking but stop to have a chat with Chippy to ask if he knows what is happening to the flowers, but Chippy only replies with a little "chirp", then runs off into a nearby bush. This is definitely strange, Chippy would always talk your ear off any time you see him on your walks, but now it's as if he can't speak.

Worried, you continue to the Fairy Queen's Castle to see if she knows what is going on.

Upon entering the Castle, you find the Fairy Queen in tears. As she looks up and notices you entering, a smile comes to her face and she flutters over to talk to you.

> I'm so glad you two are here! We need your help!

### Fairy Queen

> When I woke up this morning and was getting myself ready, I wasn't able to find my crown. I'm worried it was stolen! I know that I'm great and all being the Fairy Queen, but without my crown my magic is fading in the forest. I'm sure you noticed the flowers on your way here. I think even my magic is starting to fade on the animals that live here.  I've sent my royal knight to search for it, but it's been hours and he hasn't come back! He does have a tendency of getting himself lost. Will you be able to help me find my crown?
> ---
> When inquiring about the crown:
> I'm not sure who could have took it, although something strange happened last night. After I went to bed I woke up to the sound of some giggling from the room that I normally put the crown in at night. I wonder if whatever was the source of that giggling is the one that took it!
> When directing the players to proceed:
> A friend of mine lives in a forest clearing not far from the Castle. His name is Mr. Hoots. Years ago after helping me I gave him a give of a magical pair of glasses that could find magic. Maybe you could go ask him to borrow them for your search for the crown.

### Mr. Hoots

You enter a small clearing in the middle of the forest, not far from the Castle as the Fairy Queen had explained. Looking around, you don't see anyone but soon start to hear a "hoooo hoooo" sound coming from the trees above.

After getting the attention of the creature, you jump back as an owl comes crashing into the ground a few feet from you.

> Ouch! Sorry for almost running into you there. I seem to have misplaced my glasses so I'm not seeing as well as I usually do.
> Oh, sorry for not introducing myself, my name is Mr. Hoots. Did you come here to see me?
> -- When asked about the glasses
> Oh no, well that might be a bit of a problem. You see when I was flying around a few days ago a strong gust of wind blew them right off of my face and I haven't been able to find them sense. You are more than welcome to borrow them if you can find them. When I was flying I was right above this clearing here, so I'm sure they couldn't have gotten very far. 
> Options: Check the pond, check the bushes, check near the tree stumps.
> -- Players check around the pond
> As you look into the pond, you can see through the crystal clear water all the way to the bottom. After a few minutes of searching you don't see them anywhere, so you decide to look elsewhere.
> -- Players check the tree stumps
> As you approach the tree stumps, something shiny catches your eye from one of the hollowed out stumps. You go to that one to investigate and find a hole just wide enough to fit your hand in, but you can't see clearly what was shining from inside of it.
> -- If the players reach in to try to grab what is inside
> You find a small emerald gemstone. It doesn't seem to have any magical power, but it's very pretty so you decide to keep it.
> -- Players check the bushes
> You decide to crawl around on your hands and knees to search through some of the bushes and the nearby grass. You are about to give up on your search when you catch a glint of something shimmering under one of the prickly bushes.
> -- Players reach to the item
> You reach under the prickly bush, being extra careful not to touch the prickly parts. When you pull out your hand sure enough you've found a pair of glasses. Maybe these are Mr. Hoots magical glasses?
> -- Returning to Mr. Hoots
> Great job finding my glasses! I'm starting to get used to seeing things without them, so you're more than welcome to hold onto them for a while to help find the Fairy Queens crown. When you wear those glasses you can see some of the magic in the air around us. Sometimes, when the fairy queen was nearby I could see a bright pink glow coming from around her. I hope you can find her crown!


## Wearing the Glasses

As you put on the glasses, you see colors you've never seen before swirling through the air. After looking around left, right, up, and down you see a faint pink glow coming from down the path.

You continue down the path and see the glow continue down into a large rabbit burrow.

You enter the rabbit burrow, but quickly find that it's very easy to get lost in here. Just as you think to yourself that you wish you had someone as a guide, you hear a voice behind you.

## Bella the Bunny

You turn and see a small rabbit a few steps back up the path you came from.

> Well well well. Look who stepped into my burrow without asking! You know it's not very nice to walk into someone's house without even knocking on the door. (Bella does infact, not have a door). Could you kindly tell me what you're doing in here? I was just about to go on a run around race track.
> -- After asking about the Fairy Queen Crown or Pink Glow trail
> Well, you know, I couuuuuld show you which way to go to get through my burrow, but that doesn't sound like fun if I just did that for you for nothing. How about we have a little contest? If you beat me, I'll show you the way. You see, I just finished construction on my new, super exciting, super duper cool, race track! I'm training for the upcoming "BunRun 5000" race the Fairy Queen is holding next month. The top buns in the whole kingdom will be there and I've gotta be able to show them I'm the fastest in the whooooole kingdom. Here's the deal, we'll take a lap around my race track. If you can beat me back here I'll show you where to go. 
> -- After beating Bella in the race
> Wow! How many "BunRun 5000"'s have you girls been in before? I've never seen anyone who could run that fast.
> Well, a deal is a deal. I'll show you the way through.
> -- As you continue down the path through the burrow
> Hmm, I haven't been this way in a while, but it looks like the direction you need to head is going to take you right through the Whispering Willows. People have told me to not talk to the creatures in that forest, but between you and me, I think they are really nice, although I think something is wrong with their name.. Anyways, keep going down this path here and you'll be at the Whispering Willows. Good luck finding the Fairy Queen's crown!

## Whispering Willows

As you enter the forest of the Whispering Willows you notice it's a lot louder than you would expect for a place called the "Whispering" Willows. You continue to walk through the forest for a while and find yourself at a fork in the road. At the center of the fork you see a large tree that almost looks like it has a face on it. As you're deciding whether to go right or left down the path, you see the tree start to move and the face turns to look at you.

> HELLO! NICE TO SEE YOU! IM WILLY THE WILLOW, AND THIS HERE IS MY FRIEND DWARF FELLOW... WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS?
> *you look in the direction the tree is now facing a find a very small odd looking fellow*
> Ah yes, Spudrick the Stout is what I'm called. I'm just your run of the mill average dwarf, like every other dwarf you've ever seen!
> > *this dwarf is not like others you've seen before, sure, he has quite a magnifient beard like you would normally expect to see on a dwarf, but something is odd about it*
> I've been stuck here with our friend Willy for a few hours now and I'm really just trying to figure out the right way to go. I'm on urgent royal business for the Fairy Queen!
> -- after asking if he's looking for the crown or similar
> The Fairy Queen sent you too? After the crown went missing the Queen mentioned she heard some giggling in the middle of the night. If giggling was involved, I'm pretty sure I know who took the crown. There is this little goblin fella named "Giggles" that likes to play jokes on us all the time. I think he crossed the line with this one if he took the crown. Willy here said he saw him earlier today walk down one of these roads but he won't tell me which direction unless I solve his riddle. I've only got sprouts for brains so maybe you'll be able to answer it.
> ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ANOTHER GUESS? YOU STILL HAVE TWO GUESSES LEFT OUT OF YOUR ONE THOUSAND GUESSES?
> I don't think I'm going to be able to figure it out at this point. Maybe my friends here can give it a try? Can you repeat the riddle again for them?
> OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
> I HAVE KEYS BUT OPEN NO LOCKS. I HAVE SPACE BUT NO ROOM. YOU CAN ENTER BUT YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE. WHAT AM I?
> - when players guess keyboard, hopefully
> > spuds > What is a keyboard? I don't think we have any of those in this world. Are you sure you guys are from here?
> CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ANSWERED MY RIDDLE CORRECTLY! IF YOU FOLLOW THIS PATH TO THE RIGHT I'M SURE YOU WILL FIND GIGGLES. GOOD LUCK

### Giggles the Goblin

You continue down the road for about a hour when you hear some shouting up ahead.

As you approach, you see a small green creature standing on top of a rock. It looks like he's putting on a show for some small audience. As you get closer, you see smaller rocks set up in front of the rock the creature is standing on, all with faces painted on them. You hear the green creature say:

> It is I! Your king, Giggles the Goblin. Thank you to all of my royal subjects for gathering here today. Today is a great day for my kingdom as I've found myself a real crown!
> -- you look more closely at the goblin and see a crown on his head that looks just like the Fairy Crown.
> -- after asking about the fairy crown
> Wait, I did what? I just saw the shiny crown sitting there and nobody was wearing it. I didn't think anyone would miss it being gone? Did I really cause trouble? I'm really sorry, I just wanted to have some fun and pretend to be the king. You can have it back.
