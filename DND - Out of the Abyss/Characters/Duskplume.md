## Backstory


> Wreathed in coverings that echo the colors of a setting sun and mask clad, an ominous and surprisingly friendly Kenku shaped figure stands before you. He beseeches you to listen to his tale and take pity: “In the long, long ago- somewhere far far from here, my egg was found in a small desert town. Glass trading merchants with hearts full of light (and pockets full of gold) found me, they were a couple with no hatchlings of their own. They took the egg and sought to return me to my egg layers but none laid claim! I hatched shortly after, feathers of gold and bright eyed. They adopted and treated me like their own! When I began to show a talent for sorcery of fire and light, they supported me and ensured I was properly schooled in the arts. Growing up, I took part in the family business taking small parts in our caravan runs helping barter our glassware’s- these were the good times.
> 
> One such caravan run haunts me to this very day though. Whether by chance or fate, I ended up back in that small desert town during a local festival, conspiracy was afoot. The festival was shortly after attacked by a goblin horde which I and a few other outlanders were able to repel with no help from the locals. That is how I discovered the town to be full of cowards and cravens. Even the local priests charged for blessings, I had never been more disappointed! Unfortunately, things spiraled from here and we uncovered a hidden and evil plot. I can only recall bits and pieces these days- but know that they were trying to resurrect a dark lord… there were runes involved.
> 
> . _CAWWW_ Anyway, those brave adventurers I encountered during the festival attack (myself included) resolving to defeat these goblins and their master. We were successful but at great cost. I was cursed in a way mortal magician could ever hope to remove. In the dark ones defeat, this curse took my power… and the light… left me. I experienced dark changes to my form and have found my magic returning to me in a way that is the opposite of the light I stand for. My golden feathers and powers are gone now because of the curse; so I returned home to my adoptive parents for comfort. They screamed at the sight of me- they still claim to love and want to support me but their pain in seeing what had become of their first son was obvious and I found myself sent on caravan runs that made no sense and would take far too long to offer any profit. It’s lead to many bizarre and out of the way locations, just like this one!” So surely now, you can sell that wand to me, a tragic and noble hero for half cost- yes yes?
