## Backstory

> Tall extremely pale shadar-kai elf with a bit of a beer belly who almost always has a huge grin on his face. wears leathers over a breezy button up shirt decorated with flowers. wears a shell necklace and has bright decorative beads on both wrists and ankles. A large straw hat keeps the sun out of his eyes my parents were second generation immigrants from shadowfell, but I've never been. I grew up on the coast. My dad died when I was just a baby, since then my mom has had a bunch of partners, usually lasting until they pass. My current stepdad is an aaracokra named Zephyr. Ive had a whole mess of siblings, and a lot are still kickin. when i was around 150 my mom kicked me out of the house and told me to get a job and support myself. I worked as a sailor for a few decades but in a terrible storm I fell overboard and almost drowned. I was struggling and sinking deeper until I was saved by an ancient water elemental. After almost dying I knew my life as a wannabe sailor wasn't working and things needed to change, So I asked if the water elemental was hiring. Long story short I got the job and all I had to do was help people in trouble that I came across.

> The next couple of centuries I was a creature of the water, traveling around the sea and helping strangers. From saving shipwrecked crew to providing directions for lost sailors. It was the best years of my life, way better than a real job. easy to please boss, made my own hours, no uniform, gambled sunken treasure, life was good. up until I received message that my mother's age was catching up to her and I should visit soon. I visited her and i found out just how little my acts at sea mattered in her eyes. she spent the whole visit comparing me to all my siblings and saying I need to make something of my life. I tried to explain to her how many people I had helped out over the years but she wasn't having any of it. So now if I dont "accomplish something worthwhile with my life" and "leave a lasting legacy as her first born and only shadar-kai child" she will die disappointed in me. So I decided to leave the sea to search for something I can do that will make mom proud. but a part of me wants to just not worry about it and go back to living underwater.
