## Backstory

> Ah, greetings! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I am Ponzi Deeproot. No doubt you've already heard of me, but if you'll lend me your ear I'll share a few details of myself and how I've wound up in this predicament. You see, I've had my fair share of adventures and encounters in the realms of deception and gambling.
> 
> When the odds always seem like they are against you, you get good at making your own luck. I've had a long life spent honing my craft, often finding myself at the heart of thrilling games of chance. Travelling from one city to another, I've enjoyed the thrill of winning fortunes and occasionally leaving behind some opponents who, let's just say, weren't too pleased with the outcomes. Such is the life of a gambler, or so they say. 
> 
> Through my journey, I've crossed paths with individuals from various walks of life, including those who dabble in less savory activities. Although I've occasionally been sought after by dubious organizations for my uncanny ability to manipulate outcomes, I've always maintained my independence. Freedom is a precious thing, and I've chosen not to be tied down by any particular group.
> 
> Now, let me share an intriguing tale with you. Once, in pursuit of a high-stakes gamble, I found myself involved in a perilous game with someone of great influence. I soon discovered that the bet was rigged against me, but through my resourcefulness and quick thinking, I managed to unveil the deception and make a swift exit.
> 
> As you can imagine, such a daring move didn't go unnoticed. Certain individuals, let's call them 'persistent pursuers,' were sent after me. Their goals, however, were unclear at the time, you see, when I departed I had little more than a copper to my name. What could they be after me for at that point? Perhaps it's a simple misunderstanding or a result of my past associations. Either way, I find myself on the run, seeking refuge wherever I can find it. 
> 
> Strangely enough, fate has led me into the confines of this deplorable prison. The circumstances surrounding my arrival are somewhat hazy, sure I've been known to have a few too many drinks, but something is different about this. I've developed a notion that I was captured and imprisoned for reasons beyond my control. It helps me make sense of this strange predicament I find myself in, though the truth may be a bit more nuanced.
