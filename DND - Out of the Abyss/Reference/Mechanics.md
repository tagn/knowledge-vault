### Food and Water
Food and Water should be treated as a background. I would like it to still inform some decision making but do not find enjoyment in tracking each morsel of food and drop of water.

### Travel
Many distances covered will take multiple days. These will be vastly spent quietly maneuvering to avoid the unknown horrors of the Underdark and will simply be summarized as a time covered. When something RP worthy is present or if an encounter happens we will play these out at the table.

### Marching Order
Before each leg of movement the party will determine the marching order and other specifics of the next section.

### Exhaustion
Traveling quickly through difficult and dangerous terrain has its hazards.
Even if avoided you run the risk of depleting your energy reserves and gaining exhaustion. 

Please note the penalties.

### Madness
Many men have gone mad in this never ending darkness. This mechanic will become important as we proceed into the Underdark.

### Cover
There will be tight hallways and we now have a small party member.

- [Cover Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#Cover)

#### Hitting Cover
When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, you can use this optional rule to determine whether the cover was struck by the attack.

First, determine whether the attack roll would have hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target but high enough to strike the target if there had been no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature is providing cover for the missed creature and the attack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the covering creature is hit.

### Inspiration
This was something that did not get much use in Witchlight due to the characters inability to gain this.
I would like to ensure this is something we do more often.
My goal is to give this out for creative RP and stand out moments.

### Flexible Initiative
If you decide you would like to be closer to a party member in the Initiative order you may lower your initiative score to any score below your current initiative.

### Long Rests
These still take the full 8 hours of down time (4 for some). They can be taken as often as the heroes would like.

This does not ensure pursuers or random troubles are not present.

### Help Action
Requires proficiency for the person providing help.

### Magic In Slave Pens
Magic doesn't seem to work in here.
