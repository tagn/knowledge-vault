## Summary

## Event Log

- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] searches the spider corpses for spell scrolls. No dice.
- [[Duskplume]] attempts to deceive the group that he found a map and old key on the corpses.
- As we proceed, [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] notices some gold coins tucked behind some spider webs.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] makes an attempt to burn away some spider webs to get the gold coins. We find a few pouches of coins.
- We get into a fight with some spiders. [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] goes and steals the gold/loot while there is a spider still running away from us.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] doesn't like that [[Duskplume]] talked some shit to him, so he disguises himself to look like an 11 foot version of him and follows right behind him.
- [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] attempts to have the group reconcile things. [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] sees some thieves cant pointing towards a thieves hideout.
- We comes to a clearing, part of the path is water. There is about 50 feet of water. We're ambushed by a bunch of grey oozes in the water.
- We think [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] died, but he just swam to the bottom of the water while we fought. Turns out he is pretty much a fish.
- We make our way over to the other side of the water and take a short rest.
