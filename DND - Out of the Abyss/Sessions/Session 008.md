## Summary

## Event Log

- We take a short rest and debate on how we should proceed.
- We'll have to get tickets for a ferry to cross the dark lake.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] attempts to lead the way continuing the direction the Tabaxi was leading us.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] scores a solid NAT 1 on the survival check while we traveled.
- Turns out, we encountered a cavern full of fucking demons. [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] is nearly dropped in a surprise round.
- Maybe [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] isn't the best navigator.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] casts Charm Person on [[Duskplume]] and then forces him to fail the save.
- [[Duskplume]] asks to be called "Champion of Sarenday" and finally introduces himself to the group.
- The path forward seem to continue the cave system, heading downwards
- The path southeast goes upwards, into some kind of snaking tunnel
- The northwest, more open space, rocky, high ceiling.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] finds the book [[Kizak]] wanted us to go find on the corpse of some Tabaxi.
- We continue to the northeast, heading downwards as [[Jimjar]] mentioned the Dark Lake was at the lowest point.
- "Rule of the sea, nothings for free"
- [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] requests his torches back since the apprenticeship was nullified. [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] only gives back a single, already lit torch.
- We follow a river as it gets louder and louder until we come across a massive lake. On the shore line we see a broken down township. [[Sloobludop]] is in the distance.
- We're up at the top of a waterfall, we'll have to snake down a narrow path to continue along. 
- There is a very wet bridge getting sprayed by the waterfall we have to cross. [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] finds that there are a few broken boards on the bridge.
