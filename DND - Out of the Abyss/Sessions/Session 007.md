- We discuss what we should do about the book that [[Kizak]] requested we retrieve.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] gives the furry bag to [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]], which he identifies to be a bag of small furry creatures.
- After identifying the bag, [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] pulls a weasel out of the bag, which is prompted asked if it may be eaten.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] exits the room to ask for directions and is greeted by a group of Tabaxi asking us about a book that "went missing" in the alchemists shop during our visit.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] successfully casts charm person on the Tabaxi interrogating us, and gets him to clear our name.
- [[Kizak]] is actually a Kenku!
- Three books missing, each one that comes back will net us a healing potion.
- We're told the guy we're looking for is wearing a robe or something that is purple with silver striping.
- [[Kizak]] says he was on good terms with Fluflufar, but maybe he got an offer to be taken into another groups ranks.
- [[Kizak]] offers a 3 poison vials as a reward in addition if I'm able to provide proof of Fluflufar's death.
- We make our way following Surshar down on the lift.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] makes a lot of small talk with Surshar while we're walking to try to befriend him.
- Charm person fades from Surshar and he accuses the group of stealing the books.
- [[Winnie]] places his bag on the ground to be searched, and signals [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] to take care of him.
- Surshar turns and [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] cracks him in the head.
