## Summary

## Event Log

- Before we proceed, we discuss whether or not Winnie can swim, which then 
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] bets 4 gold that he won't fall into the water. Then another 2 gold that [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] WILL give him his pay back his gold and not steal it.
- We start off down the path further, with [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] leading after [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] gave him another 10 torches.
- We come up on some dimly lit crystals, but its not enough light to not carry a torch.
- In the clearing, we see a cave ending with a stone wall that states: "I have a tail, but I have no body, I am not a snake, what am I?" [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] guesses that it might be a coin.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] places 20 gold into the opening and the wall begins to open to reveal a few individuals beyond it. There are five, black humanoid cats. They each are wearing armor.
- Turns out the group found themselves in the middle of a meeting room of some hideout.
- We have absolutely no understanding of the names that they provide to us.
- After some discussion about our "intrusion", we make up with them. [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] hands the "leader" one five gold during a hand shake.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] notices that they intend to rob us that evening.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]], feeling a little sad that nobody had acknowledged/introduced him, produces a long set of credentials to introduce who he is, which is followed by a discussion about him potentially haven stolen something like a spell book from [[Menzoberranzan]].
- We follow another Tabaxi that entered the room on our way to the alchemist.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] attempts to whisper to [[Duskplume]] that we need to stay on our guard, but he seems overwilling to accept the friendliness of our Tabaxi hosts.
- [[Kizak]] the alchemist lets us know that his last forager ran off with his book to identify mushrooms/etc.. He says it would be useful if we were to retrieve it. The book is purple and says [[Kizak]] is large letters, written in Undercommon.
	- Down past the elevator we might run into the guy that ran off with his book, Fluflufar. [[Duskplume]] gets a deal with him for three potions plus whatever regular reward if we're to get back his book for him. He definitely doesn't *want* the guy to be dead, but it wouldn't be the worst thing if he was dead.
- We make our way to the accommodations they have prepared for their guests. [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] talks to [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] and requests to be woken when he is awake after his first rest.
- Halfway through the night, they bring some mushrooms into the room. [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] is handed two trays of food/mushrooms.
- The rest of the night is uneventful.
- We awaken to a loud ass conversation between [[Duskplume]] and [[Buppido]] about the reason [[Buppido]] was in prison, turns out, Murder!
