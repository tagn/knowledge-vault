## Event Log

- We pick up on the bridge, trying to escape from some presumed Drow guards.
- [[Jimjar]] tells us that we've got to get down to get out. Take the lift.
- Lift needs to be manually turned to make it function.
- We hear rustling in the nearby room, which appears to be some sort of kitchen.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] convinces [[Eldeth]] to go investigate the kitchen for some travel provisions.
- Combat begins, [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] spots some key rings in the back of the room, darts in, snatches some, then disappears. (1/2 uses of Hidden Step left for today)
- The [[Quaggoth]] charges [[Eldeth]] and kills her.
- [[Ront]] starts getting fucked up by the guards and gets knocked unconscious.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] gets his shackles opened up with the keys he swiped.
- [[Duskplume]] breaks his shackle free
- We start fighting the guards because people are slow as shit.
- [[Jimjar]] bet Ponzi a gold that he could hit the Drow in the head, he hit the shoulder and now owes Ponzi 1 gold.
- We kill the guards and the [[Quaggoth]].
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] snatches some poisoned bolts and a grappling hook off the bodies
- We descend from the lift and start heading south, as [[Quaggoth]] are descending the walls to try to get us.
- We see [[Mistress Ilvara]] on a bridge above looking down on us.
- We follow [[Buppido]] to the south through some narrow passageways.
- We come up upon a 100ft wooden bridge. The drop into the ravine appears to be about 200 feet.
- Everyone crosses the bridge without issue.
- [[Duskplume]] attempts to communicate with [[Buppido]] about finding a place to rest.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] cuts the bridge behind them.
- [[Jimjar]] awakens and says we just cut the only bridge between [[Dark Lake]] and [[Menzoberranzan]].
- There are a few cities near the [[Dark Lake]], the [[Durrogar City]], and [[Blingdenstone]].
- While the group is resting, [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] sneaks away, disguises himself to look like [[Eldeth]], then sneaks up on [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] and whispers into his ear "You did this to me...", then he goes invisible and reappears as normal back on the other side of the group.
