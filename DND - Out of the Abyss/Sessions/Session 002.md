## Event Log

- We pick up on the bridge, trying to escape from some presumed Drow guards.
- [[Jimjar]] tells us that we've gotta get down to get out. Take the lift.
- Lift needs to be manually turned to make it function.
- We hear rustling in the nearby room, which appears to be some sort of kitchen.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] convinces [[Eldeth]] to go investigate the kitchen for some travel provisions.
- Combat begins, [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] spots some key rings in the back of the room, darts in, snatches some, then disappears. (1/2 uses of Hidden Step left for today)
- The [[Quaggoth]] charges [[Eldeth]] and kills her.
- [[Ront]] starts getting fucked up by the guards and gets knocked unconcious.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] gets his shackles opened up with the keys he swiped.
