## Summary

## Event Log

- We're taking a long rest. [[Buppido]] seems to be chasing something in his sleep. [[Shuushar the Awakened|Shuushar]] is in a meditative state.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] wakes up and starts hallucinating that [[Duskplume]] has feathers again.
- [[Duskplume]] "wakes up" paralyzed.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] insists he is fine, but just this one time he says that [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] may lead the group.
- [[Shuushar the Awakened|Shuushar]] tells us he doesn't know the best way to proceed to [[Sloobludop]], he directs [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] to ask [[Jimjar]].
- [[Jimjar]] tells us that we need to go to an expanse, and there is a bridge made of webs that we need to cross.
- [[Duskplume]] isn't moving, we try to wake him by pouring water on him.
- We try to figure out if he's dead, nothing we can detect.
- Ty conjures a familiar up named [[Ilkazor]], which is a tiny Quasit demon that keeps screeching.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] has a conversation with [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] as we walk that he thinks [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] is the only sane person left.
- [[Ty Feteru|Ty]] is optimistic that [[Duskplume]] will wake up sometime within the next month.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] stops being completely crazy, and [[Duskplume]] breaks out of his paralyzation.
- We enter an area that is about 150 feet wide, the bridge in front of us has collapsed. There appears to be a "deadly" drop. There is a path to the north and another to the south.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] speculates the Drow headed us off and cut this bridge.
- [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] suggests maybe trying to get us a rope or something across the gap. He scouts ahead with his flight.
- [[Jimjar]] says the tunnels are in worse condition than when he last traveled. He says to the north there is the [[Hook Horrors]] cave. The other path is unexplored.
- [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] feels that the [[Hook Horrors]] cave path is deadly. The group decides to go to the unexplored route to the south.
- [[Jimjar]] mentions that the spiders aren't exactly friendly, and a lit torch may be a lure for them. [[Duskplume]] insists we extinguish the torch and [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] is to hold hands with him, but he declines the offer and continues on.  [[Winnie Eveningfog|Winnie]] starts flying at a lower elevation once we start to see spiders on the walls and ceiling.
- We get into a fight with a bunch of spiders. After [[Duskplume]] used Darkness during the fight, [[Ponzi Deeproot|Ponzi]] was convinced it was the spiders doing.
