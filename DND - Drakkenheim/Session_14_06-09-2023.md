## Session Event Log

- The group has crossed the river
- Perception check
	- Can see Castle Drakken a bit better now, we're relatively certain we see things flying around it
	- Streets/buildings are in better condition on this side
- We start searching for the inn into the city on the north side of the river
- We hear laughing and whatnot as we approach the inn. Building looks pristine as we creep up
- Three story inn, beautiful spire, built of black wood
- Building seems out of place, everything around it is destroyed but this looks like the style of 20 years prior, like as if it wasn't damaged.
- Building gives off no magic, no good/evil detected
- We enter, about 35 patrons inside, we are the worst looking people in this room. It's dimly lit by candles
