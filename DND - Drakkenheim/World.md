## Rumors

- The Noble Man, in his noble home, Withered, old, and all alone. His stare can chill you to the bone, a pale man on a pale throne.
- The Trolls of King's Gate will let you pass for a price, but it will cost you an arm and a leg.
- I heard there are delerium crystals the size of a horse within the crater. Imagine how much they'd be worth!
