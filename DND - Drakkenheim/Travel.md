Moving through the Streets Ruined buildings and maze-like streets are exceptionally difficult terrain. How fast characters can move on foot depends on their priority:

## Fast
At this pace, characters advance one mile per hour. They take the most direct route to their destination and move openly on major streets. Characters cannot use stealth, and make Perception checks with disadvantage. When checking for random encounters (see “Random Encounters” later in this chapter), each character rolls twice and takes the lower result.

## Normal
At this pace, characters advance one-half mile per hour. They proceed carefully through the ruins staying vigilant for threats and landmarks. Characters cannot use stealth, but may make Investigation and Perception checks with advantage.

## Slow
At this pace, characters advance one-quarter mile per hour to evade hostile threats. They sneak down back alleys and avoid major streets. Characters may use stealth, and make Perception checks normally.
