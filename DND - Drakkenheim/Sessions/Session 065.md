## Summary

## Event Log

- We discuss things over with Lady Frostgleam as we travel across her lands to see Grannie.
- [[Silas]] can't seem to commit to harming grannie if it comes to it.
- We arrive at an opening where the trees from the forest seem to stop. Ahead of us is a barren land, but there are no leaves. Mostly just sticks. No wildlife. The extra feeling of safety is wavering.
- The group accepts a boon from the Lady Frostgleam, with the condition that we end Grannie's life.
	- Boon of Radiant Clarity
- We make a sanity check when entering the forest.
- A large milky white dragon has taken to the air and is soaring back through the forest where we came from.
- Grannies magic is a bit widespread, control people, divine things about whats going on, lots of charm type stuff.
- We take a little resty westy and then.... EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
- Silas has a "dream", but it's Grannie directly talking to him telling him she's going to send for him. 
- [[Edahi Ghastliness]] appears at our camp, offering to escort us to Grannie, but [[Silas]] casts banishment on him and sends him off to "safety".
- Walking towards grannies house, about 30 feet ahead of us the ground explodes.
-
