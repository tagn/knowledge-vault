## Summary

## Event Log

- We discuss things over with Lady Frostgleam as we travel across her lands to see Grannie.
- [[Silas]] can't seem to commit to harming grannie if it comes to it.
- We arrive at an opening where the trees from the forest seem to stop. Ahead of us is a barren land, but there are no leaves. Mostly just sticks. No wildlife. The extra feeling of safety is wavering.
- The group accepts a boon from the Lady Frostgleam, with the condition that we end Grannie's life.
	- Boon of Radiant Clarity
