## Event Log

- [[Theodore Marshall]] wants us to disregard any offers that we get to do things to prevent them from being able to take the gate.
- The plan for us has now shifted for us to not approach from the rear/inside of the city to get to the Cathedral. They'd want us to ride with their Griffon riders and assault the gate towers/etc.. to help them get in.
- The Black Iron Pact is now going to be inside of the city already, finding a way to sneak in.
