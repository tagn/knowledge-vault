## Summary

## Event Log

- We return to a foundry update, still on our shopping trip in the new cool magic shop.
- We discuss the magic items available.
- [[Silas]] buys himself the **Gliding Cloak** from the store
- We also buy the **Blood Pearl**, some armor for [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]].
- We're going to go to [[Buckle Down Row]].
- [[Rose Carver]] is dead, replaced by a Bugbear named [[Bohemia]]. We receive our payment for opening the smuggler's tunnel.
- We intend on going over towards the [[Black Ivory Inn]] to meet up with [[Queen of Blades]]
- [[Silas]] polymorphs himself into a Giant Swam to ferry everyone over the river to get to the [[Black Ivory Inn]].
- The Queen suggests us take a second look at [[Eventide Manor]]
- The Queen wants us to give her or be available when all of the seals of drakkenheim are assembled to assist her with crowning a new ruler.
	- Sihrr decides to be indecisive on if we'll do it or not. We may or may not have 72 hours before it's stolen from us.
- We make our way back across the river on Swan [[Silas]] and back to [[Buckle Down Row]]. We take a short rest to replenish ourselves before heading towards the [[Champion's Gate]].
