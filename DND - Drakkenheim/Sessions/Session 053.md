## Summary

## Event Log

- Leaving the Cathedral, we travel for about 15 minutes and start to notice the ground below us feels unstable.
- The ground collapses below us. Keth and Silas manage to hover using "cloaks", but Sihrr and Arken don't manage to save themselves.
- We fall into a chamber with various Delerium dregs that attack us on sight.
- We feel like it's possible the room we fell in might have been some kind of large communal dining area.
	- Silas scrapes a little bit of the "goo" out of the corpse of the Bloated Ghoul
- We make it back to the clockwork tower, Arken touches the door and goes unconscious, we cautiously make our way up to the top.
- Arken has been affected by a spell "magic jar". It is a 6th level spell necromantic spell. We dispel the magic on Arken's body and return him to it.
- Silas casts Comprehend Languages on the Vials
	- Five vials have the names of the current King, and five kings before him.
	- The vial that Sihrr touches has the name *Ulrich the Fourth*, glows, a faint illusory script says Grandson.
	- Silas would know when the Meteor struck Drakkenheim, Ulrich was elderly.
