## Summary

## Event Log

- We make another con save, [[Sihrr]] no longer has an arm, its a tentacle. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is covered with continuously popping boils.
- Statues in the garden appear to be of some mythological creatures.
- The garden seems to be tended by some sort of fey creatures. We make multiple failed attempts to ask them to provide us with some lilies.
- We wander into a more thickly wooded area inside the park.
- In the distance we spot some four floating lights, darting into the woods. We try to follow the creatures, they wander into a grove of glowing flowers. In the middle of the patch there is a body.
- The flowers don't appear to look like lilies, perhaps glowing roses.
- As we arrive in the grove, we see the glowing lights/creatures across from us.
- [[Seven]] attempts to use a rope and grappling hook to snag the body, but doesn't know how to throw shit.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] approaches the body and attempts to inspect it, but it apparently was some sort of apparition. He is rushed from behind by one of the balls of light, which shocks him.
- We prune a few of the glowing flowers off, but continue on.
- We leave the grove, into steps leading up to a raised platform. We walk up some steps towards some sort of statue.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] recalls the prior queen of Drakkenheim was very much about vanity, was very good to servants/etc..
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] checks out the statue of the Queen for anything interesting, no luck.
