## Summary

## Event Log

- We get up in the morning, and perform our preparations for the battle.
- The hooded lanterns successfully start the day by initiating a pincer attack.
- As we approach the gate, we see a few ballistas on top of the towers, as well as many Garmyr. In the air we see a few Chimeras
- We're on the ramparts, the towers peak about 10 feet above us.
- We succeed in opening the gate. We exit to a pile of dead Garmyr, and various soldiers.
- We regroup with the commander of the Silver Order as they are in the process of setting up fortifications to repel a counter attack.
- Following the soldiers, we stick to alleys and approach the Saint Vitruvio cathedral.
	- Encircling the temples steps the fallen bodies of 50-60 Garmyr soldiers.
	- A line of spikes guards the path to the cathedrals doors.
	- On some spikes, some really fucking mutilated Black Iron pact members are there.
	- We see coming around, Elias Drexel and a small contingent of lanterns retreating from a large pack of Garmyr and hell hounds. Retreating towards us.
	- We successfully save Elias Drexel and most of his group.
- We're told that beneath the Cathedral, the royal family had a vault where they stored documents/etc..
- We enter the Cathedral, it's fucking filled with Garmyr berserkers and Hell Hounds, but at least we have some of the Hooded Lanterns with us.
