## Summary

## Event Log

- [[Arken]] arrives in town and gets caught up on the situation with [[Sihrr]]. 
- [[Sihrr]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] try to talk themselves into the [[Watchtower]].
- [[Ansom Lang]] comes outside, the two of them argue with him and inform them that [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] is imprisoned for murdering three hooded lanterns.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] gives up his weapon, [[Sihrr]] gives over his staff and necklace/amulet? Perhaps that was his Holy Symbol
- They follow [[Ansom Lang]] inside the watch tower. They are led up to the third floor. They have seen 4-5 times the amount of soldiers here 
- They proceed into an empty room, with a window. It's a trap! They have a small chat while waiting.
- A few minutes later [[Ansom Lang]] returns with a hooded figure, a few guards, and someone that appears to be from the [[Knights of the Silver Order]].
- They are informed that [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] has admitted to the conspiracy to place a known dangerous package.
- The group is offered to be taken to the Garrison in the city to be witness for a public execution for [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]]
- They plead to try to save [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] from being executed, then they show [[Petra Lang]] to them, who is now disfigured due to the bomb.
- There is more back and forth trying to plead and figure out how to save [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]].
- They convince [[Ansom Lang]] to let them them see [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] one at a time.
- [[Sihrr]] goes to talk to [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]]. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] goes and gives [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] the pamplet for handling delerium for something to mull over.
- The group leaves to find [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and reconvene at the [[Bark & Buzzard]].
- They decide to try to recruit the [[Queen's Men]] to go to war with the [[Hooded Lanterns]] to try to save [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]].
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds [[Blackjack Mel]] and attempts to convince him to help. He tells them that the [[Queen's Men]] don't have much to gain from a war with the [[Hooded Lanterns]].
- After failing to get the [[Queen's Men]] to help, they try to go recruit [[River]] for help.
- The group continues to talk to every single fucking person in the town before they actually do anything.
- Austin falls asleep waiting two hours for a decision to be made.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] get into a wagon with [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] chained up. 
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to force them to swap [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] for herself.
- She is tearing up, is very reluctant but gets in the wagon to travel to the garrison with the rest of the group.
- We arrive up at the [[Shepard's Gate]]. [[Ansom Lang]] reveals himself and the group gains entry, although [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] is about to get fucked.
- Not very far past the [[Shepard's Gate]], the group rolls up on the [[Drakkenheim Garrison]].
	- This is the base that the [[Hooded Lanterns]] fought and died to take control of in the city.
	- They've only had it for about a year. It's the only location within the city that we know anyone has been able to obtain.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] has some last words with the group, and is taken up onto the gallows.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] dead.
- The group is returned [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]]'s possessions, and is forced to give up their cloaks.
- They then realize, they are not permitted to get out through [[Shepard's Gate]]. They are given a job to regain access through the gate to leave.
- The group goes and looks at the [[Academy Gate]] and it looks shimmery, maybe covered in webs. They decide against approaching it.
- The party encounters [[Seven]], on the way to the Queen's Park Garden
