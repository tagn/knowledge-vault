## Summary

## Event Log

- During our downtime, we've run back into the Gentlemen Bastards at one of the bars and exchanged tales. He tells us they got lost in the city, took a chance by jumping into the sewers and were led back to safety by a group of fishlike people.
	- They recent received a summon by the Queen of Thieves, maybe they'll run into us down at [[Buckle Down Row]].
- We get into a discussion between [[Seven]] and the pals about his background. We start to get into talking about the [[Amethyst Academy]] and [[Sihrr]] has informed us the previous leader of the group was [[Archmage Adriana Modiera]].
- One evening, a big bar fight breaks out. We got our ass kicked. It seems that it was noticed that we had a poor performance. [[Blackjack Mel]] got to see us get our ass kicked.
- [[Sihrr]] was around the city for quite some time. He wasn't in the city when the meteor fell, but hadn't been back until he came back in with the group. He reveals that his holy symbol is pretty much just a piece of costume jewelry.
	- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] asks about the "old man" that [[Sihrr]] has been looking for. He is back in the city trying to find him.
	- [[Seven]] wonders why [[Sihrr]] would be worried about being recognized in the city. He insists nothing now, he was originally worried in his youth about being taken but this person he is looking for helped teach him to avoid them and such.
	- [[Seven]] asks [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] about the [[Delerium]] implant.
- We arrive at [[Buckle Down Row]] and look for a drink, we wander to the [[Sneaky Mcgee's Bar]].
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] notices a dark cloaked figure sitting with their back facing us over talking with [[Veronica Venom]].
	- We take a seat at the bar.
	- We're offered drinks, [[Seven]] declines. [[Seven]] is pulled in by the collar because he didn't thank [[Rita]]. 
	- [[Veronica Venom]] and others head over to inform us we need to thank [[Rita]] when we order.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] asks [[Veronica Venom]] about the pit, the figure cloaked in black stiffens up a bit when it was mentioned.
	- [[Veronica Venom]] informs us this figure is somewhat of a "champion" for their group.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] asks if he is an "actual champion" and the figure stands up. He pulls back his hood. Bald, really regular ass looking human.
	- He says nobody has earned the Queen's favor. She might be in attendance this evening.
- We walk out of the bar and notice three Drow standing out in the street. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] is invited in to join them in the [[Sweaty Bugbear]].
- [[Seven]] casts comprehend languages and sits down at another table in the bar to eavesdrop.
- This group was sent from [[Vattix]] bearing "peace". They recently learned there is quite a tournament going on in [[Buckle Down Row]]. Her debt may be lessened with some creative wagering.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] tells them that she would never "run out" on [[Vattix]]. She tries to lie to them that she never left him, she is still part of the group.
	- They want us to win the first two fights and they would bet on us.
	- There will be a fight with "Mamba" and they want [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] to go down. They would wipe half of her debt out after this.
	- If they lose money on the wager, it will be considered part of [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]]'s debt.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] would know these specific drow are dressed as if they were fighters from a noble house.
- [[Seven]] mentions that if he's in a fight, he has no plan on throwing it.
- We consider letting the bookies know that there is a new group of Drow in town trying to rig some of the fights.
- We make our way to see [[Rose Carver]] about fighting in the pits.
- Rose throws a purse of gold over to [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] as payment for what they've been able to smuggle using the tunnel.
	- We're told there have been some creatures in the tunnels that have led some of their people astray.
	- Some people in the water have been "changed" by the [[Delerium]] and they can still speak while being "Delerium Dregs"
	- She introduces us to three other girls
		- Becca the Blade: Been with them for a while. A Tabaxi
		- Kristy the Knife: A dwarf
		- Sarah the Spoon: Appears to be humanoid. She sounds to be the strongest one of the group. She goes over and sits on [[Sihrr]]'s lap while we talk.
- The "Hammerhead" guy that broke [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]]'s nose in a bar fight, fights with the Cobra gang.
- When [[Sihrr]] is blown a kiss by Sarah the Spoon, her face seems to shift a bit. 
- Matt talks about a boner.
- [[Rose Carver]] offers to escort us to get signed up to fight and help us make bets.
- [[Blackjack Mel]] enters the bar and lets us know he's going to be "heading downstairs" to take registrations for the fights.
- We take a ladder down into the sewers. They seem to have revamped a section to be a fighting arena. We're introduced to [[Patty Thomson]] and her assistant [[Marv]] who are there to try to heal up those who lose.
- There is a prisoner room containing a few ex-members of the gangs who are forced to fight. The fighting arena is a large room, with a dirt floor.
- There is a central area marked off with barricades. There are about 40 people waiting around for the matches. There is a large man named [[Bull]] who is refing the fights, and a halfling named [[Rocky]] who is taking bets for the fights.
- There is a young boy, around 15, named [[Tig]] who seems to be running a shop. He buys and sells stolen items. He is a "premier sewer seller".
- We enter to earn the queen's favor, with 2v2 matches, fighting on behalf of [[Rose Carver]].
- We attempt to bet a thousand gold. The most they could get the bookie to take was 650. 
- We find out in the first round we'll be fighting "Smiley Pete", a dwarf with no teeth, and "Glass Jaw Jake", who looks like he's already had his ass kicked that evening.
	- We're told by [[Rose Carver]] that these are some weak thugs.
- [[Blackjack Mel]] hops up on a crate to start announcing the upcoming fight.
- [[Seven]] offers the other team to surrender, [[Smiley Pete]] refers to Seven as a "Woody wood bitch" and is immediately shot in the throat by [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]].
- We thrash them, then collect ~1950 gold from our bet.
- We watch a few more fights in the first round.
- Then they bring in two fighters from the [[Wounded Hearts]], 
- Sarah the Spoon attempts to cozy up to [[Seven]], he pushes her away.
- Our group wins the fight, after being pretty heavily injured.
- A group of Minotaurs comes in next and fights the [[Gentlemen Bastards]].
- We're up next against Mamba Jones and Hammerhead. "The Vipers"
- The Queen is in the crowd. The fight starts with [[Seven]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]]. 
- [[Seven]] takes a fucking beating, but we win the fight.
- We watch more fights commence. The Queen hops down into the middle of the arena, with [[Blackjack Mel]] standing about 10 feet behind her.
- Two groups are trying to win the Queen's favor.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is going to enter us to fight for the Queen's favor, and something hits [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]]. The drow seemingly did something to [[Keth]], but we don't know what.
- [[Rose Carver]] slides us a very heavy purse because we've won the fights so far. +2500 gold.
