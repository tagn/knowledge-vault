## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up right after our combat.
- The group investigates the sewers travelling towards the direction of the inner city.
- After exploring for a bit: inside the Sprawl area, we have a decent idea of where entry and exits may be within the sewers.
- We search around and find 6 [[Delerium]] chips. Silas keeps one.
- We search for signs of the [[Queen's Men]] or similar and end up finding a small cache with 25g and a potion of healing.
- We fail an encounter check while searching for more [[Delerium]].
- Used Vital Signs against Sihrr, down until I short/long rest for him. (Recovered it on a short rest)
- After dispatching the two ogre looking fellas, we dip out before the water weird becomes reactive again.
- Our next search finds us 6 [[Delerium]] fragments
- We continue searching towards Drakkenheim inner city to see if there is a pathway in via the sewers.
- Silas receives a mutation, two eyes manifest from his crown on either side.
- We wander near to the Temple Gate and find a shanty town/encampment near the gate, with a bunch of Garmyr? It seems like way too much to handle ourselves.
- We find a metal fence/portcullis that may lead into the city. We'd have to break it or something to get through.
- Keth finds some markings depicting some information about the Garymr camp.
- We find ourselves in another precarious situation underground in the sewers. Some strange creatures break themselves off of the wall.
- Used Vital signs on Arken
