## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up right after our combat.
- The group investigates the sewers travelling towards the direction of the inner city.
- After exploring for a bit: inside the Sprawl area, we have a decent idea of where entry and exits may be within the sewers.
- We search around and find 6 [[Delerium]] chips.
- We search for signs of the [[Queen's Men]] or similar and end up finding a small cache with 25g and a potion of healing.
