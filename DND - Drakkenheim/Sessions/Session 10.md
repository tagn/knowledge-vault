## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- Small young gnome walks up to us
- Dr. Weevil tries to offer us "medical" assistance, after we mentioned needing a doctor for Arken
- We head towards the "old imperial public house", 
- Sihrr spots a small elvish girl wearing the same pin as the one Keth has
- We talk about Keth joining a club that is definitely not a gang, but is definitely a gang
- Sihrr introduces us as Keth's Krew, with a K
- We get introduced to Rose, the leader of Keth's new club
- We're told about the "Black Ivory Inn", Will may have heard of it in passing many years ago. This place is north of Buckle Down row, past the river.
- There is a passage that runs underneath of it, used to send goods back and forth throughout the city. Recently something in the Inn has made the passage impassable. "A cousin Mike" used to run the tunnel, leads right into the city, bypassing the walls. They recently sent a crew out that did not return, the second crew they sent out said the Inn was lit up, music, etc..
- We're told the river is contaminated, there are creatures in it
- If we can secure the building, we'll be paid handsomely for the service, and in perpituity pay us a percent of all of the goods they are able to smuggle out of the city.
- To join the rose shits, we'd have to pay 5% of what we make back to them
- Once a week, there is a wishing well, they make payment to the queen
- We go with Keth to make the payment to the Queen
- Keth pays the tribute, we leave the city to get Arken back to town.
- We pass our check and head back to town
- One of the guards outside the watch tower notices us coming back into town, runs over, and tries to get us to come in
- Arken and Sihrr go to the Church, no flamekeeper but Arken is going to wait
- Ansom Lang requested us
- He has a "particularly tricky" job for us
- There is a person, Oscar Yorn, a bit "weird", who is gifted at making potions, who supplies the Hooded Lanterns. He supplies the potions, they supply protection, they didn't receive the latest batch. Ansom wants us to go track him down. He resides in Reed manor. Normally he would send an apprentice to the Shepard's Gate with a shipment. The week prior he only sent half of the normal order, some of the potions were contaminated. We're offered 250 gold and a weapon from their cache, a longsword or longbow with magical properties. He is "at odds" with the Amythest Academy. They had an exclusive offer to deal with him.
	- We possibly make a deal with Ansom to do the job
- Go back to Arken, hes still waiting for the doctor

- Oscar practiced Alchemy/Necromancy. When he was confronted with it by the Academy, he fled into the city. 
- We try to convince arken to go with us to Zoya, at the Shrine of the Old Gods, but he refuses
- We leave and go to the Shrine ourselves to check it out
- We run into Zoya at the Shrine
