## Summary

## Event Log

- After our seemingly successful reverse heist, we make our way to the [[Watchtower]] to collect our payment from the [[Hooded Lanterns]] for completing their request with the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves.
- We're allowed in to see [[Petra Lang]] and discuss our interaction with the Dwarves.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] informs [[Petra Lang]] that they should keep an eye out for the dwarves attacking innocent passerby's.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] inquires if the [[Church of the Falling Fire]] members have ever showed aggression, they have not.
- We ask about how we're benefiting from the deal that we made with them, we are told about the deal where they will give us some of the equipment they get from the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves.
- [[Petra Lang]] leaves the room and returns with soldiers carrying a crate/box and offer each of us a [[Hooded Lanterns]] cloak. We each get a Cloak of Elvenkind.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] asks [[Petra Lang]] if they've happened to see his parents. She talks about pulling people out of the city shortly after the event, and in the following few months after. She says its unlikely his parents are alive at this point. She offers to look through some records they have on hand to see if there is any trace of them. [[Sihrr]] detected her thoughts during the conversation and got mostly pity from her surface thoughts, she has had to give a lot of bad news and it seems like this is the same kind of situation.
- We give the [[Hooded Lanterns]] some information about the haze creatures we encountered.
- As we head back through town, we see a congregation of knights in front of the [[Chapel of Saint Ardenna]].
- [[Sihrr]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] go into the [[Chapel of Saint Ardenna]] to see what's going on. There are members of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] there looking for a staff. They want to ensure that the [[Queen's Men]] does not take possession of the item. It's located at the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]] on the outskirts of the city. We're to bring the staff out to [[Camp Dawn]] if we're able to retrieve it.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] inquires on what we should do if we run into other members of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]]. He is given a pin to show them so they know we're working with them.
- [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] seems a bit down about the discussion and abruptly leaves the circle.
- [[Sihrr]] asks [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] if they've had any reports of the pilgrims getting killed by the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves. She had not heard about that happening.
- [[Sihrr]] discusses with [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] that [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] is now seeking another group of adventurers to help them retrieve the staff for the [[Church of the Falling Fire]].
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] make their way to the [[Skull & Sword]] for breakfast. On the way in [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] salutes the skull. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] does not and hears a loud voice in his head that said "IGNORE ME AGAIN AT YOUR PERIL", and he takes a small amount of psychic damage.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] searches around town and finds [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] having breakfast at the [[Skull & Sword]]. They go to meet [[Sihrr]] over at the [[Red Lion Hotel]] to talk to [[River]].
- [[Sihrr]] recalls that [[Saint Vitruvio]] died quite some time ago, well before the meteor hit [[Drakkenheim]]. He knows that there was a relic of [[Saint Vitruvio]] that was one of the "Seals of Drakkenheim". Potentially by claiming the relics could allow people to reconsecrate an altar in his cathedral. The items that he held are of immense magical power, any faction would be more than happy to find one. These relics have been lost and have been sought out for hundreds of years, but nobody has ever found them. This information was kept to [[Sihrr]] himself.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] would know the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]] was in the Spokes area, it wasn't too far from where his family grew up. There was a playground and a large open field that he would go out and play in. This was a common community gathering center. There is a crypt underneath the chapel.
- [[Sihrr]] by himself goes to discuss with [[River]] that the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves aren't up for an exclusive deal with the [[Amethyst Academy]], but they might be able to work themselves in to take over the purchasing of the [[Delerium]] from them. She doesn't seem super happy about the situation but he was able to persuade her to at least continue dealing with us in the future.
- We start to discuss going back into the city with haste to try to get a lead on the staff. We know the letter mentioned it might be underneath the Chapel.
- We intend to head out of the city, but stop by Aldor's to purchase some potions/etc.. before we leave.
	- Aldor has a Brooch of Shielding, Bag of Holding (1500g) and a small deck of sealed playing cards (not a full deck, roughly 20 cards), you can shuffle the deck and draw one at random, when you draw one you can throw it on the ground and an illusory creature will appear in that location based on which card you draw.
	- Aldor gets up out of his chair and comes over while we are discussing what we'll pay. He is willing to give us the bag of holding outright, but the next magic item that we find belongs to him.
	- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] attempts to flick [[Aldor the Immense]]'s nose, and has to make a huge constitution saving throw and passes it with a 20.
	- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] spent 50 gold of his store credit to buy a Potion of Healing. He has 200 gold remaining.
- On the way in to town, we kinda sorta fail an encounter check but "it gets rolled into what happens at the Chapel"
- We approach the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]] in town. One tower remained standing, one was broken. Elegant stained glass windows decorate the chapel.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] notices some recent horse tracks near the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]], in the area leading up the hill. She hears a faint shattering of glass up ahead.
- We see five warhorses tied off to the trees near the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]], we believe them to be horses belonging to [[Knights of the Silver Order]]
- We sneak up towards the Chapel to see inside. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] gets a closer look by jumping up to a higher level to peer in. She sees what appears to be a few [[Knights of the Silver Order]] searching the place. Its some sort of captain plus four other knights.
- A door opens and some of the knights approach us, [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] quickly hide while [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] stay out in the open to talk to them.
- They explain that they've been there a few hours and can't find a way down without destroying part of the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]].
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] approach to go inside the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]] to check it out.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] circles around to the south, [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] circles around to the north.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] don't notice anything immediately. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] notices the crypt thing to the north was recently disturbed.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] walks into an area with a statue nearby and finds a group of people. She is not immediately noticed. One of the members of said group seems heavily burned. There are eight other "bandits" there with him. They are trying very hard to pull a rod out of the statues hand.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] find stairs down and finds a locked heavy iron gate portcullis.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] heads inside and lets the group know about the bandits outside.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] stays high up on the top of the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]] to keep an eye on these suspicious bandits.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] summons his echo in front of the bandits and begins combat with them.
- We easily slay the bandits.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] begins to inspect the area around the statue. 
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] identifies the statue to be holding an immovable rod.
- Non-magical silver euer? Some kind of scrolls.
	- 1 Bless scroll
	- 1 Faerie fire scroll
	- 2 Continual Flame
	- Silver Euer
	- Silver Holy Symbol of the Sacred Flame
	- Three vials of annointed oils
	- Block of incense
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] give the Bless scroll to [[Sihrr]]
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] goes down the stairs and hears some things beyond it. Cackling, etc.. in a language she doesn't understand.
