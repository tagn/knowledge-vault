## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up with our group just having entered the lower level of the [[Chapel of Saint Brenna]]. 
- The room we are in is filled with urns, clay pots, painted vases. There are alcoves cut off into the sides. There are some lit and burning candles resting atop human skulls on the ground.
- Vaulted ceilings are about 10 feet. We notice an interesting breeze flowing different directions through the chamber. 
- "Stay there meatbag, you're trespassing, you better have brought something nice." We see multiple "mephits" in the room.
- There is a one inch notch just below the top most edge of the cylindrical metal post. We think possibly we can use the immovable rod to turn it, but have no idea what it might do.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] goes back to the porticullis to set a mental alarm incase someone else approaches. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] takes the immovable rod over to [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Sihrr]] and heads back to keep watch for [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]].
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Sihrr]] search around while they wait for the others to catch up.
- We regroup and head down the stairs into what seems like a burial chamber.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] get the idea that the skeletons were some sort of religious rite, they were placed here. The skeletons have Citrine gemstones placed in their eyes. Each are clutching a gold or silver holy symbol.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]], while on the other side of the chamber, steals some gems off of one of the skeletons. Suddenly the lights go out and the skeletons animate and attack.
- Stone slab in the center of the room. The door quickly slams shut after [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] removed the rod upstairs.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] goes back upstairs and inserts the rod, then locks it in place. The door opens and stays open.
- We enter the burial chamber and [[Arken]] begins a prayer for what appears to be the corpse of Saint Brenna. [[Sihrr]] notices shuffling of bones in the hallway that we just came from.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] gets chased around the room by the mummy of what we assume to be [[Saint Brenna]], terrified of her.
- After combat, [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] throws the gems at one of the final skeletons. 
- Engraved on the door "None are forever lost to shadow, candlelight glows brightly in the darkest night"
- "May the sacred flame keep vigil over the souls of our revered dead". The circular room has various murals on the walls.
- The murals appear to depict the process to lay a cleric or paladin to rest. They prepare the body, place a gemstone on each eyelid, holy symbol in their hand. Priest anoints the body with holy water/sacred oils. Priest places candles around the body. Priest reads some scroll out to them.
- We find another burial chamber, with what appears to be some paladins/clerics that had been laid to rest. There is a helmet and a greatsword that appears to be etched and glowing.
- "No darkness is eternal while our faith fuels the flame"
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] head upstairs leaving [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] inside of the second burial chamber to move the rod from the second contraption back to the first.
- Back downstairs, the chamber door we entered from shuts behind [[Arken]] and [[Sihrr]]. After swapping the rod, the opposite door opens revealing another chamber populated by [[Saint Brenna]] and various skeletons.
