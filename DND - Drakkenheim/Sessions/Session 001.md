## Session Summary

In the first session of the Dungeons and Dragons 5e campaign set in the Dungeons of Drakkenheim, the adventurers gathered at the Come on Inn. They were promised 25 gold each upon their arrival in Emberwood Village. Their leader, Eren Marlow, was accompanied by his pet collie dog named Elizabeth. The party's task was to escort a wagon filled with general store supplies.

As they prepared the wagon, the characters introduced themselves. They were then asked if they wanted to travel back with Eren to Emberwood Village. Along the way, about a week into their journey, they were ambushed by a group of cutthroats led by a man named Bogdon. The assailants were known as the "Queen's Men," a notorious gang that practically ran Emberwood.

During the fight, one of the party members displayed a rather unpleasant personality by splashing acid on people. The group managed to defeat the attackers, but one of their party members named Keith fled, leaving behind his lover, whom they unfortunately killed.

Later on the road, they encountered three individuals heading from Emberwood Village towards Drakkenheim. Among them was Ludvig van Groth, Rickard, and Endra. They seemed reluctant to reveal their companion's disfigurement and set up an alarm between the groups. However, one of the party members, Keth, attempted to steal from them. It was revealed that the disfigured companion was a mutated creature known as a delirium dreg.

During the night, Ludvig was brutally murdered, his skull crushed by an unknown assailant. The party learned that the mutation had taken place in just 48 hours. Upon reaching Emberwood Village, they were greeted by a woman named Emma.

They had several locations to explore within the village, such as the Barkin Buzzard, where they were instructed to ask for Karen and mention Eren's name. The group heard rumors about Sammy Eight Fingers, who had been pinned down somewhere in town by the "Lord of the Feast." Other notable locations included the burned-down Eventide Manor, the Gilded Lily tavern (which lacked beer but had a talent show), and the Skull and the Sword, where a mutant named Marco the Shark had his head cut off.

They also learned about the Caravan Park, where a merchant named Grinning Greg had encountered the Queen but never returned. The marketplace was set up around a boarded-up water well. The Hooded Lanterns ran the watchtower to the north of town, and the Chapel of Saint Ardenna housed a lady capable of bringing people back from the dead.

Other locations included the Red Lion Hotel, run by a former reeve, the Crow and Sons Smithy, run by Emma's father, and Aldor the Immense's magic shop, which dealt in magic and delirium-based items. The adventurers perused potions, spell scrolls, magical items, and various materials.

In a bar, the party met a group known as "The Gentlemen Bastards," led by Renard. The group included an elven woman named Lyrian and a bugbear named Grummish. The party considered talking to the Amethyst Academy about their plans to enter the city of Drakkenheim, but were unsure about The Spokes. They also discovered that the Gilded Lily hosted an open mic night and were advised to speak with the Hooded Lanterns, who maintained neutrality in the town.

At this point in the session, Wyldenten Proudsky, one of the party members, was heavily intoxicated from drinking.
