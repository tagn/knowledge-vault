## Summary

## Event Log

- We head over to the Rose Theatre to see if Ryan can assist us getting to the fey wilds.
- Ryan Greymere gave us some information, but was unable to help us get to the Fey Wilds.
- We likely need to talk to the Amethyst Academy directly
- The Queen could help us in exchange for the head of Elias Drexel.
- We return to Emberwood and Arken somehow charms a guard on our way back into town.
- We convince Eldritch Runeweaver to transport us to the fey wilds.
- Silas strips naked and the gate to the city lets him in. Sihrr and Keth both give the gate a nice compliment. Arken runs into the gate and it hits him, then he lays on the ground and is allowed in.
- An ice elemental slides out in front of us and turns itself into a shape of a wall. 
- We're instructed by the frost elemental to make our way to the lodge prior to going anywhere else since we're mostly from the material plane and they aren't super fond of them.
