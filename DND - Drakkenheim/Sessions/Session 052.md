## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up in the scriptorium.
	- The south of the room has a statue with an aperture device
	- The west side of the room has another aperture door, but the light does not extend far enough to reach it
- We go back down to the room to the south, and redirect the lights to open another door
- We enter a room with a statue of some paladin in the center
	- Saint Vitruvio
	- Cavities in the statue at the right thigh hold the remaining bones of Saint Vitruvio
	- Hundreds of lit candles
	- A mirror shield is affixed on the wall to the south.

	- The shield on the south wall was easily removed, revealing another aperture. Keth attempts to light it by reflecting the beam but nothing happens.
