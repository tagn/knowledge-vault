## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up in the scriptorium.
	- The south of the room has a statue with an aperture device
	- The west side of the room has another aperture door, but the light does not extend far enough to reach it
- We go back down to the room to the south, and redirect the lights to open another door
- We enter a room with a statue of some paladin in the center
	- Saint Vitruvio
	- Cavities in the statue at the right thigh hold the remaining bones of Saint Vitruvio
	- Hundreds of lit candles
	- A mirror shield is affixed on the wall to the south.

	- The shield on the south wall was easily removed, revealing another aperture. Keth attempts to light it by reflecting the beam but nothing happens.
- We take three of the shields up with us, leaving the remaining shield inside of the sealed crypt.
- We go down the left stairway into the catacombs.
- Arken angles the statue towards the path, revealing another burial chamber. We angle another beam above an empty grave site and it opens another room.
	- Keth loots a few spell scrolls, we also find another shield.
- To the north, is a room with a large marble fountain, with a tragic looking statue. The statue depicts an angelic man looking up towards the heavens. Hands rest an inch above the fountain
	- Above the fountain are four evenly spaced iron handles.
- To the south, we find what appears to be another tomb. All of the candles have gone out. On one of the tombs is a shining shield.
	- All of the mummies in the room arise as we enter.
- Blood Elemental HP =>
	- 64 - 6 - 6 = 52
	- 52 - 22 = 30
	- 30 - 7 = 23 - 12 = 11 - 4 - 5 = 2
	-
