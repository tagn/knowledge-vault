## Event Log

- Contact other plane questions:
	- Will the confrontation with the one I previously referred to as my grandmother result in violence? possibly
	- In exchange for my service, with the condition that my friends are off limits, will you bless me with the strength to fight? no
	- Are you able to provide safe passage to return from the fey wilds, back to Drakkenheim in the material plane? possibly
	- Do you know of Lucretia, leader of the Church of the Falling Fire? no
	- Will following Lucretia bring ruin to my companions? yes
- [[Silas]] tells the group about his collect call, then a bit of the backstory with his Grandmother.
- Silas gains a contamination level during his sleep
- [[Sihrr]] uses his scroll of scrying on grannie. The orb appears in a corner of a "cozy" cottage.
	- Grannie is sitting with a bell in her hand, in-front of a table. On the table is a map of Drakkenheim.
	- On the map, there is an X on the map with the Kleinburg Estate.
	- There is another X where Oscar Yorn was.
	- There are a bunch of circles drawn around the Cathedral.
	- Grannie rings her bell, and someone that could pass as a younger brother of Silas enters the room. She slaps him because he was too slow.
	- She writes something on paper, then looks up at the scrying orb and pulls it in.
- We awaken and proceed to have breakfast at the inn.
- We approach the front desk and inquire about how to return to the Fey Wilds.
- The innkeeper hands us a business card that she can reach us through on if she has found a way for us to return home.
- We leave town, going towards grannies house. We arrive at a cliff with a steep drop of about 800 feet and find our way down.
- We take camp for the evening at the base. Everyone has shitty dreams. Sihrr and Keth lose some "Sanity". Silas does not. Arken dreams of a fucking demon entering the Cathedral, killing Lucretia, the demon looks like Milando.
- Silas gains a contamination level during his sleep..again.
- We are at a large expanse called the Frostveil Sea. We encounter a Giant that Silas attempts to sweet talk unsuccessfully because he can't speak Giant.
- We defeat the giant and put it to rest.
- We encounter a 200 foot long fucking bird. Silas banishes it and we run the fuck away.
- At some point in the past Silas talking to his grandmother, there was a conversation regarding the "gateway staircase" which acts somehow as a shortcut. 
- [[Sihrr]] purges the contamination from [[Silas]] gaining him 3 levels of exhaustion.
- [[Silas]] drops a level of sanity after a bad dream, now down to 4.
