## Summary

## Event Log

- We approach the house of [[Oscar Yorn]], one of the zombie ogres knocks on the door. After a short while one of the handy helpers answers and steps outside to greet us.
- We enter the house requesting an audience with [[Oscar Yorn]]
- If we encounter a Chuule again, they'd like the sack inside of it.
- We inquire about buying/selling potions. Matt buys some Aqua Delerium, we buy a few "healing potions"
- Gemma made some shitty potion, now Oscar is mad.
- We try to fuck up the deal between [[Oscar Yorn]] and the [[Hooded Lanterns]].
- [[Seven]] attempts to make some mutations happen to himself so [[Oscar Yorn]] can try to tinker with him, but after gaining three levels of contamination it doesn't have any effect.
- [[Klingberg Estate]] might be a lead on finding [[Justin Tousant]] for [[Sihrr]].
