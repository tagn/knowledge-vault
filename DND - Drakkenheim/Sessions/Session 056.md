## Summary

## Event Log

- We do some shopping and buy two greater healing potions and two regular healing potions.
- Keth gets a tip about the hazewalker plate being quite valuable.
- We discuss some plans with the iron banshee, but probably will end up winging it.
- The temple gate seems more fortified since the last time we had been there.
- We're allowed passage through the gate.
- The rose theater is the "magic dome place". 
- We talk to a super useful guard who had "bumped into" the dome, but knocked and nobody was home.
- Keth introduces us to the Iron Bitch by attempting to dig under it with a shovel. She's super stoked about it.
- Keth admits that we're sent by Milando to try to get the armor from her.
- She made the armor herself. She believes it is the only set of it.
