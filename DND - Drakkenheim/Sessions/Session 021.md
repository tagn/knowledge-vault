## Summary

## Event Log

- We begin after taking a short rest, as [[Mordecai]] is explaining we can come to an agreement he is hit with a few arrows and is dropped to the ground.
- We see a group of Garmyr approaching, wielding torches and bows/crossbows.
- "Rush them", says the leader of the dwarves.
- After a few rounds of combat, we defeat the Garmyr. 
	- They had 67 gold
	- A swirly green liquid in what resembles a mason jar, it appears as if there are fireflies in it.
	- A handful of arrows
	- 2 delerium shards
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] inquires with the dwarves about if they've been attacked by other factions/etc.. They mostly get attacked by monsters.
- They say they may be interested in the deal with the [[Hooded Lanterns]] as long as they will be ensured that they get help.
- They tell us that they don't get attacked much during the day.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] really insists that the dwarves are going out of their way to kill the falling fire members. He searches through the corpse piles and finds two members of the falling fire that are shot to death.
- We call one of the dwarves over and try to get some information about the bodies.
- We don't get a super clear answer about what the falling fire did to provoke it.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] suggests that we get the dwarves to drink to get their guard down, then get more information out of them.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] speaks with the dwarves and they seem forthright about the situation with the falling fire.
- We walk over to the [[Watchtower]] to and start bringing [[Ansom Lang]] over to discuss the finer details with them about the arrangement.
- [[Ansom Lang]] makes the deal with the dwarves that they'll be supplied weapons, and send some men to help protect them, also let them stay at the garrison so they don't need to make the full trek back.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] goes over and makes a sale to Aldor of the two delerium shards for 500 gold plus 500 gold store credit.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] accept 250 gold, with [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Sihrr]] taking some store credit.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] goes to talk to the falling fire about what we saw and seems to be working out setting up our group to force us to believe what they are saying.
- We talk out what we want to do about the box that the [[Queen's Men]] want us to deliver to the [[Hooded Lanterns]].
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] proposes some sort of strategy with rope trick to hide nearby.
- We plan on: Having [[Sihrr]] distract the a transport cart sent by the [[Hooded Lanterns]] to the [[Shepard's Gate]]. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] will sneak the package into the cart while [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] hide in a rope trick above the road.
- [[Sihrr]] disguises himself to distract the guards for the cart. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] successfully plants the box. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] confesses to [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] that he put a message on the box.
- We start to look into flipping a house in town to use as a proper base of operations.
