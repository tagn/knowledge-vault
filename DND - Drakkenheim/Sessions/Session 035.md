## Summary

## Event Log

- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is now a snake person.
- We intend to go into [[Drakkenheim]] to take our escort over to the [[Queen's Garden]] with the guy we met over at [[Oscar Yorn]]'s abode.
- We fail our encounter check while going into [[Drakkenheim]]. We encounter a group of knights of the Silver Order. They seem anxious with us around, we quickly continue on our way.
- We approach the [[Academy Gate]] and Marco suggests we don't go through there.
- We go down to the [[Shepard's Gate]] to attempt to pay the [[Hooded Lanterns]]. They ask our business, we refuse to tell them at first, then suggest we're going to the [[Queen's Garden]]
- [[Petra Lang]] comes and greets us. She seems partially healed, and her voice is rough.
- We pay 100 gold to get through the gate.
- The gate will close at sundown. 
- We roll double 1's on our initial inner city encounter check. We hear some sort of screeching. A wraith looking creature comes out of the wall and attempts to drain the life from [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]].
- Next, a naked appearing human with taloned hands and bird wings comes flying at the group and charms us.
- RIP [[Seven]]. Used a heavy blow to force myself into a monstrous transformation to give the party an opportunity to run.
