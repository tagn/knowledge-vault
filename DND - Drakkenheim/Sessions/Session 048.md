## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up after the bridge gauntlet. There is nothing of particular interest on the corpses.
- We head back to the clocktower before heading back out.
- We speculate on the idea of sneaking through the Garmyr, but don't really decide on anything
- After a long rest, we head down towards the Champion's Gate to get back towards Emberwood.
	- In the South Ward, very few structures are standing. There is a thick fog of the deep haze blanketing the area.
	- There is some stone, brick, and timber that is facing the crater and appears melted.
	- There is a acrid/pungent smell in the air, as if a weird material was burning nearby.
	- Every so often we hear crumbling rock or some remnants of structures that are collapsing.
- We arrive over at the [[Champion's Gate]]
