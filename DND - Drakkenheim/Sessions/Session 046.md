## Summary

## Event Log

- Leaving the falling fire's output at the [[Champion's Gate]], we come up onto a familiar face that we noticed back in the [[Skull & Sword]].
- We end up in a fight with the shitty racist adventuring group.
- They escape by touching their rings, but we manage to down the last one before he can escape.
- We torture the guy a bit then murder him.
- We recover ourselves a bit, then proceed towards the nearest bridge to scout it out.
