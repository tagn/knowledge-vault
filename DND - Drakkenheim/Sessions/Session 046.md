## Summary

## Event Log

- Leaving the falling fire's output at the [[Champion's Gate]], we come up onto a familiar face that we noticed back in the [[Skull & Sword]].
- We end up in a fight with the shitty racist adventuring group.
- They escape by touching their rings, but we manage to down the last one before he can escape.
- We torture the guy a bit then murder him.
- We recover ourselves a bit, then proceed towards the nearest bridge to scout it out. 
- The loots from the dead holy man:
	- Star of Iron, heavy staff used for melee attacks. 2d6+5 bludgeoning,
	- The ring: If the user is not in the Cyst, they teleport to the Cyst, if they are in the Cyst they teleport to another place of their choosing
- We make it back to our tower, the Silver Order has chained the door shut. We pick the lock an enter, barring the door behind us.
- [[Silas]] dismembers the corpse and keeps the heart to return to Lord racist
- We scout out the Chapel of Saint Vitruvio, it looks like the Garmyr are forming a sort of army. They appear to be led by the Lord of the Feast.
- We finally head towards the fuckin Library
	- Large wooden doors, closed, but in good condition.
	- Round building
	- Bookshelves are still mostly intact. Some have been knocked over.
	- Spiral shape on the inside.
