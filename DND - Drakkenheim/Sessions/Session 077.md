## Summary

## Event Log

- We seem to be able to see about a mile from the clocktower now. The haze seems gone.
- Walking down the clocktower, everything seems to be as it was before.
- The courtyard to the clocktower is restored upon going outside.
- Everything outside seems to be actually restored, and intact.
- The facade of the demonic temple appears to be adorned with infernal sigils, the surface etched with torment and torture, twisted pictures of writhing and agony. Above the door is a bust of some creature.
	- The visage seen above the door is very recognizable, the lord of hell, azmodeus.
- We chase Sihrr towards his family home, the city
-
