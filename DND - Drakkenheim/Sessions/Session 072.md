## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up right where we left off in the alchemy lab.
- We head up to the Medical Ward, there are mummies in one room, and the next room over. 
- We find some sort of sleeping draught in the room.
- We head up to the Scriptorium to continue our search.
- We temporarily see a ghostly figure, then it disappears. We search around the room and Keth seems to stumble into it first and gets stunned.
