## Summary

## Event Log

- We make our way over to the [[Red Lion Hotel]] to try to catch up with the [[Ironhelms]].
- There appears to be a few dwarves, surrounded by a few others that seem to be guarding them
- We grab a table close to the dwarves to ease drop a bit before we try to talk to them.
- We request a corking service because we brought our own wine. The server obliges and brings us some food to go with the wine.
- One dwarf is in a black cloak with a trench coat, I see a few daggers, he has a long scar across his face and a long goatee that goes to his belt buckle.
- Another dwarf is wearing common grey robes, thick leather straps and a breastplate on top. Some sort of mechanical trinket. Long brown hair. Lots of tools and instruments.
- [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] is on the night shift at the smithy. They come and go to and from the smithy.
- The female dwarf is not Gertrude, but she offered and cast a healing spell on [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] to heal and cleanse her. Her name is [[Eloise]].
- We ask to accompany them into town when they head back to the smithy.
- They say we can go with them after a shift change around noon the following day. They have a shift change at the [[Red Lion Hotel]] at noon.
- [[Eloise]] has a brother named [[Mordecai]]. 
- [[Sihrr]] pays our tab of 10 gold and we head back home.
- We find a box waiting in front of our house. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] tries to pop it open and it won't open. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] detects magic on it and gets some abjuration, with some kind of necromancy inside.
