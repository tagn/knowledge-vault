## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick ourselves back up after nearly losing the last fight.
- [[Sihrr]] torches the corpse of the "hero" child
- The rest of the group proceeds to head towards the group we were escorting and on to the [[Champion's Gate]].
- As we approach the "gate", it seems to be pretty damaged. We get caught up with the back of the escort group.
- We see some guards at the gate tending to the wounded.
- We notice a person we have not yet seen before, based on their presence we assume it is [[Lucritia]].
	- She appears about 5' 1", in her 90's. Long white hair wearing a hooded black robe. She is laying hands on people as they walk through the gate. There appears to be a radiating sense of calm coming off of her.
- [[Sihrr]] goes to talk to [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] about getting to meet [[Lucritia]], then finds he is missing his tongue after our last fight.
- We proceed over towards [[Lucritia]] and witness her healing a small girl.
- She leads us towards a small white tent, which is the only visible structure that we see at the gate.
- [[Lucritia]] asks us to gather around a small fire inside of the tent. She sits down and opens her tome before her and flips through the pages.
	- We join hands and she begins a low chant.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]]'s tentacle arm starts to swell and feel petrified.
	- [[Sihrr]] grows back a second eye.
	- [[Seven]] loses his milky eye.
	- [[Arken Highbloom]] feels like his tongue is starting to grow back.
- We see about 30 or 40 people not pilgrims that are just hanging out here.
- We inquire with [[Lucritia]] about other tasks they might have for us.
- [[Sihrr]] has [[Lucritia]] assist with questions about the man he is looking for, [[Justin Tousant]]
	- She asks if he is alive, he receives what is likely a "yes"
	- She asks if he is present in the city of [[Drakkenheim]], he receives a "yes"
	- She asks "is he himself", it spins a half turn clockwise, then breaks and falls into the water.
- We don't have much time left in the haze. [[Lucritia]] departs the tent and we start to get a sense back of reality of the situation we're in.
- We encounter some weird fish folk that rush at us singing on our way back to [[Emberwood Village]] after failing an encounter check.
- We wipe the floor with the creatures.
- We continue back to [[Emberwood Village]] to the [[Chapel of Saint Ardenna]] to see [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] about getting some contamination cured.
