## Summary

## Event Log

- We leave [[Buckle Down Row]] on our way to to [[Emberwood Village]] after the conversation with the Queen's Men and get lost along the way about 40-45 minutes from [[Buckle Down Row]].
- Down the road we spot two minotaurs...that are dressed as pirates?... [[Minotaur Pirates]] They are brandishing great axes and look like they don't want company.
- [[Arken]] starts the encounter by slashing one of them up.
- A "pirate" rhino charges from the south alleyway up towards our group and gores Arken.
- [[Arken]] is going on a god damn murdering spree taking down a minotaur and rhinocerus.
- The Pirate Wizard calls in a lightning storm on the group.
- The Minotaur in front of [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] rips off his shirt and rages, hitting him with a critical hit.
- Pirate Wizard shouts [[Korgath]] will hear about this and misty steps away
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] goes through the Minotaurs pockets
	- 6 or 7 in-tact strands of beads
	- Greataxe
	- 47 gold
	- Badge sewn into his leather in the shape of a black horn, similar to a minotaur horn.
- The pirate wizard, named [[Freddrick]] tries to convince the group that he is a wandering merchant. [[Sihrr]] convinces him to drop down off the building. He is unarmed, a parrot on his arm, and wearing boat shoes.. He also has a badge with the black horn, but his is on a chain around his neck and it's made of what appears to be a real minotaur horn.
- He tells us that he was sailing the [[Drann River]] bringing supplies to Emberwood and was waylaid by minotaurs and forced to work for them for a year.
- He tells us to stay off the river
- In his pocket [[Keth]] finds a decree signed at the bottom by [[Korgoth Blackhorn]] put in charge of putting down a raiding party for [[Buckle Down Row]]. They were instructed to find the best path down the river to find reinforcements. He tells us that for a time he was enslaved but kind of became part of their family.
- We search his pockets
	- 176 gold - split 44 gold each.
	- Jewelry pieces on his fingers
	- Pocket watch
	- His staff was left up on a roof
- We bind [[Freddrick]] up with web from [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] 
- We discuss not being so damn brutal and killing people that don't need to be killed.
- We drop the guy off at the [[Watchtower]] and explain he might be a person with useful information for the [[Hooded Lanterns]].
- Things are different getting back into [[Emberwood Village]] down towards the Caravan Court, it sounds like a party is going on. Next to [[Aldor the Immense]]'s shop there is a large 15-20 foot long steam wagon. It's sitting on the ground flat, and there are port holes in the side. There is a dog wearing full plate armor, and stamped on the plate armor is the word: [[Jaziel]].  A very eccentrically dressed man is on top of the wagon. The wagon has a sign that says [[Azan the Wanders Shop of Wonderous Mysteries]]. It appears that the wagon might traverse using some legs that come out of the port holes.
- Whenever someone makes him an offer, his dog is tugging on his pants, somehow influencing the bartering process.
- He has a few items laid out for sale:
	- A shortbow. Clearly magical in nature, on the front of the bow it appears as if its coming out of the mouth of a goblin. The merchant tells us the bow belonged to a Goblin Shaman he knew a few years back. Every time you take a shot at someone with the bow, it yells out random Goblin curses. It seems to inflict more damage from the language of the bow. The person who is using the weapon seems to gain some magical ability. [[Keth]] inquires about the price and is offered to barter.
	- A one-handed battle axe. The edge of the axe is black, while the rest of the blade is a normal silvery metal.
	- A ring with charges, if we kill something within 30 feet, we can extract some of the remaining life of the creature and store it in the ring. Later you can use that to perform other tasks. - Offer crown plus 400 gold for the ring.
	- Various tattoos that can imbue magical effects.
	- Vial of spiders - 888 tiny spiders. They will magically obey your verbal commands, they can't harm any creatures, but they can be used as sentries. About 100g
	- Amulet - A liar stone, any magical effects/etc.. to detect thoughts will convince whomever that the lie is true for 24 hours.
- The dog seems to be able to speak. Introduces himself as [[Jaziel]]
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] barters to buy the ring and vial of spiders in exchange for the Rat Prince crown plus 500 gold.
- The day wraps up, [[Azan]] opens up a portal and he and his cart move through it.
- [[Armin Gainsbury]] describes to [[Keth]] that [[Azan]] is a legend around here. He showed up one day and started selling magical items and such.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] gives [[Armin Gainsbury]] a stack of custom made "customer loyalty cards" to punch out to benefit his repeat customers.
- We go investigate the [[Eventide Manor]] as a potential place for us to stay.
- There are some weird things happening at the manor, some shingles falling off, a shutter slamming, creaking footsteps on the stairs, mystery footprints.
- [[Arken]] finds an opening into a cellar. We descend down into it. It's a pretty big space. About a 50'x40' rectangular room.
- [[Keth]] investigates the cellar and gets trapped in a wall of force after touching a portion of the wall. She also took a lot of poison damage and became poisoned.
- [[Keth]] is trapped in a wall of force. Someone invisible tells [[Keth]] that they would help us find a new place if we didn't talk to anyone in town about anyone being there.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] realizes whomever is in that manor is a very powerful spell caster.
- On the next session, we should follow up on the dwarves we saw going up to the [[Red Lion Hotel]]
