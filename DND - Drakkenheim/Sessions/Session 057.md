## Summary

## Event Log

- Leaving gramps, we head to scout out the Inscrutable Tower to see what's going on.
- As we approach the large plaza surrounding the tower, it comes into view.
- The cobblestone street breaks and becomes a large campus park. There is a pond, surrounded by arcane arches. Near the tower we're feeling pretty restricted due to the deep haze. It's hard to tell what's there without going in. The Delerium seems to be growing up around the pond within the tower grounds. "There is effectively a forest of Delerium crystals here grown up around the tower. "
- The lake appears to be man-made, in the center of the park area.
- Arken sends in his echo for scouting out the area. He sees 3 [[Protean Abomination]] and about 5 [[Gibbering Mouthers]] in the area
- The tower is about 150 feet wide and has been smashed apart roughly 2/3 of the way up. The top of the tower hovers above, defying gravity. Between the sections there are pieces of floating debree. Eldritch lightning fills the area.
- Arken did not successfully scout out any sort of entrance to get into the tower.
