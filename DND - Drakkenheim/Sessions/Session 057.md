## Summary

## Event Log

- Leaving gramps, we head to scout out the Inscrutable Tower to see what's going on.
- As we approach the large plaza surrounding the tower, it comes into view.
- The cobblestone street breaks and becomes a large campus park. There is a pond, surrounded by arcane arches. Near the tower we're feeling pretty restricted due to the deep haze. It's hard to tell what's there without going in. The Delerium seems to be growing up around the pond within the tower grounds. "There is effectively a forest of Delerium crystals here grown up around the tower. "
- The lake appears to be man-made, in the center of the park area.
- Arken sends in his echo for scouting out the area. He sees 3 [[Protean Abomination]] and about 5 [[Gibbering Mouthers]] in the area
- The tower is about 150 feet wide and has been smashed apart roughly 2/3 of the way up. The top of the tower hovers above, defying gravity. Between the sections there are pieces of floating debree. Eldritch lightning fills the area.
- Arken did not successfully scout out any sort of entrance to get into the tower. 
- We head to the Library
	- Keth finds paper and ink
	- Silas finds a tale of someone who came to Drakkenheim when the city was young, 600-700 years ago. This was a passing tale that the entire city was centered around the inscrutable tower, when nothing else in the city was more than a story or two tall.
		- Digging further he finds a book on ruins. This book details that this is a building, as far as anyone knows, has always been here. This building predates Drakkenheim, predating the Amethyst Academy. The initial founding of the city was around this tower. No real record has ever been found of its construction.
		- It's one of three widely known strongholds of the Amethyst Academy.
- We get back over to the Cathedral after coming up with nothing major at the Library.
- We find there to be a reasonable mass of people hanging around the Cathedral. There are about 25 members of the Falling Fire, working on cleaning up/performing repairs. About 15 members of the Silver Order. Standing on a small pulpit in the center of the Cathedral we see Lucretia reading out passages. 
- In a few days there will be a meeting of some of the factions.
- Arken asks Lucretia about the Phylactery. She insists it's not the original after study with the Academy mages.
- Sihrr catches something odd from a comment Silas made about the Phylactery not being found.
- We head back out the Temple Gate towards Emberwood.
- We come home to Milando sitting in our house, smoking a pipe, eating some cheese.
- [[Milando]] starts to intimidate [[Keth]]. If we don't get the armor for him, there will be a different kind of meeting when he comes back.
