## Summary

## Event Log

- On our way back to Emberwood, we encounter a heavy rainstorm. We enter a building to take shelter. Stepping inside, we see an elevated stage/platform. It's pitch black inside. We hear a rhythmic pounding coming from deeper inside the building. It's hard to tell what the source of the sound is, its perhaps drums, or a bed frame ;).
