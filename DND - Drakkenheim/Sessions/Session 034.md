## Summary

## Event Log

- On our way back to Emberwood, we encounter a heavy rainstorm. We enter a building to take shelter. Stepping inside, we see an elevated stage/platform. It's pitch black inside. We hear a rhythmic pounding coming from deeper inside the building. It's hard to tell what the source of the sound is, its perhaps drums, or a bed frame ;).
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] takes the lead sneaking into the building to figure out if there is something causing the sound. The group follows from a safe distance back.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] hears the banging coming from further back. [[Seven]] checks in then takes a seat and wait to see what happens.
- [[Sihrr]] shouts out it might be the "hands". He hears something back behind us skittering.
- We enter combat with a large red toad. A creature floats through a wall, it's incorporeal but retakes physical form after it passes through the wall.
- [[Seven]] dies half a dozen times. Mostly to [[Sihrr]] because he's out of his fucking mind.
- We find in a back room of the building what may be a smuggling tunnel.
- We find a locked door to a room, inside we find a ring with a shield looking thing on it. A staff with two bright white wings coming off of it.
