## Event Log

- Keth is rolled up dead in a bag. Woot!
- We arrive at the cathedral, there is a sermon being given by Lucretia.
- Lucretia lies to us for some reason about using resurrection.
- We give her some shit about not helping us.
- We ask the Queen, she refers us to Lucretia or the druid to the north.
