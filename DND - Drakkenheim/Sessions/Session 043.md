## Summary

## Event Log

- We rolled up to the Kleinburg estate.
- There appear to be nicer keeps/estates/mansions in this area. The buildings seem to have survived the meteor almost fully intact for the most part. Up above looming we see [[Castle Drakken]], but it's still a ways away.
- The [[Klineburg Estate]] sits atop a hill. It has steeped terracotta roofs. Walls are solid and standing, with some small amount of decay. All windows appear to be shattered and boarded over. Downhill from the main house there is a stable. We also see the remains of a collapsed stone tower.
	- The grounds are surrounded by a ~10 foot tall stone/metal wall with spikes.
	- There is a road/path going in, no standing gate between two guard towers.
	- From outside the gate we can't see the entrance to the house.
	- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] notices what appears to be recent cart tracks on the road. They seem to be frequently used, as there is a groove worn into the road.
		- He also notices foot prints, roughly humanoid, no shoes, along the path.
- We slowly approach the gate following [[Sihrr]], who has cast Detect Magic.
- Stepping out of the guard tower on the left is a hooded humanoid, with a "janky" walk. He says "eeeeeelo" in a ghastly voice.
	- "Welcome to the Kilneburg Estate, what's your business?"
	- He doesn't know a Justin, but we're directed to go speak with Raven, who is at the stables to the left.
