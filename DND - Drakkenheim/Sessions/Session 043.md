## Summary

## Event Log

- We roll up to the [[Klineburg Estate]].
- There appear to be nicer keeps/estates/mansions in this area. The buildings seem to have survived the meteor almost fully intact for the most part. Up above looming we see [[Castle Drakken]], but it's still a ways away.
- The [[Klineburg Estate]] sits atop a hill. It has steeped terracotta roofs. Walls are solid and standing, with some small amount of decay. All windows appear to be shattered and boarded over. Downhill from the main house there is a stable. We also see the remains of a collapsed stone tower.
	- The grounds are surrounded by a ~10 foot tall stone/metal wall with spikes.
	- There is a road/path going in, no standing gate between two guard towers.
	- From outside the gate we can't see the entrance to the house.
	- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] notices what appears to be recent cart tracks on the road. They seem to be frequently used, as there is a groove worn into the road.
		- He also notices foot prints, roughly humanoid, no shoes, along the path.
- We slowly approach the gate following [[Sihrr]], who has cast Detect Magic.
- Stepping out of the guard tower on the left is a hooded humanoid, with a "janky" walk. He says "eeeeeelo" in a ghastly voice.
	- "Welcome to the [[Klineburg Estate]], what's your business?"
	- He doesn't know a Justin, but we're directed to go speak with Raven, who is at the stables to the left. 
- A brackish pond is west of the manor house. Several hooded figures wander the property, some are watering flowers, one of throwing rocks in the pond. The stable off to the right does not seem like it may house any horses any longer.
- The mansion is a large two story property. Above the doors, there is a round stained glass window with a radial design. One window on the front right is not boarded up.
- The stables appear to have been makeshift workstations. Inside we can see many hooded figures. The front looks to have been made into a sort of shop, selling various alchemical ingredients. The cart inside the stable looks like it has been kept in perfect condition. There appear to be no horses that pull it. 
- The haze hulk, [[Raven]], appears to be a portly woman with blue skin and white glowing eyes, thick stringy black hair, wearing a burlap cloak with a large hood. She speaks to us. We noticed when [[Raven]] stood up, all of the figures in the stable stopped what they were doing and turned to face us simultaneously.
- [[Sihrr]] informs [[Raven]] that we're looking for [[Justin Tousant]]. No one by the name Justin lives here, we may leave.
- [[Raven]] beckons us over to the inside of the stables as she is currently working.
- [[Sihrr]] offers to assist, she puts a tray in-front of us.
	- [[Silas]] thinks it's a lime flavored healing potion.
	- [[Sihrr]] believes that [[Raven]] is in the process of making Aqua Delerium.
	- As we attempt to make an Aqua Delerium potion, we gather an audience. The hooded figures appear to be haze dregs, but don't appear to be aggressive. 
	- We fail to make the potion, using most of her reagents. She pours it out saying that "father" would not accept it.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] goes and checks out the inside of the cart discretely. It's quite bougie.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] notices a colossal haze creature in the back of the stable. He appears to be reading stories to some of the other haze creatures.
	- [[Silas]] convinces the group to give over the Aqua Delerium. He hands it over to [[Raven]] in an attempt to gain her as an ally.
	- She says father is busy, if one of us wants to go she can have grunt take us.
	- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] insists we'll be discrete, as [[Raven]] leans in [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] vomits on her, which then [[Raven]] eats it.
	- [[Raven]] calls [[Grunt]] over.
	- [[Grunt]] looks over, [[Silas]] has a book, there are no words. He goes back to where the dregs are and starts reading them a story, while using Disguise Self to turn himself into "mini grunt".
	- [[Raven]] goes back inside and sits patiently back at the table.
	- [[Sihrr]] goes with [[Grunt]] towards the house.
- The group does what the group does best. Completely split the party.
- [[Sihrr]] approaches the house in the company of [[Grunt]]
	- Staircase leading upwards.
	- To the left and right, doors lead to the different wings.
	- There is a lot of horse-related artwork within the house.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] goes and checks out with [[Raven]] is doing. Her brain hurts from potion making, obviously.
- [[Keth]] goes to peak inside of the house. It appears to be "drawing rooms" that people would historically wait in. It seems in disrepair.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] jumps up on the roof, I guess.
- What is our play? No clue!
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is spotted when [[Grunt]] returns, [[Grunt]] attempts to grab him, but [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] bails out quickly. [[Grunt]] closes and locks the door with [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] back outside.
- [[Sihrr]] follows [[Grunt]] around inside of the house while [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to sneak through.
- [[Sihrr]] enters the room with the "pale man". It's been nearly 20 years. This man is [[Justin Tousant]].
- It's hard to tell if this is a happy reunion or not. [[Sihrr]] attempts to take a knee, and the pale man stops him and directs him to an open chair. They take seats.
- Speaking with [[Sihrr]]:
	- The [[Pale Man]] says he is alive in "a way". It's not much of a life but it is sustaining. Why are you back in the city? I was happy when I first heard of your escape. Did you come to the city to find me?
	- He has spent the last two decades trying to remain in the city. He has been attempting to restore some level of dignity or sanity to the creatures. He says he has sacrificed so much for these creatures.
	- He does not seem fond of people adventuring into the city to steal/loot/etc..
	- He perhaps has something to ask of [[Sihrr]]. He asks if we stay in the city or outside.
	- He asks [[Sihrr]] if he is aware of someone back in [[Emberwood Village|Emberwood]] named [[River]]. He says it would mean a lot to him if he could bring her to him at the estate. He wants to have words with her. She has sent many people to try to rob him of his knowledge, and wants to have words with her to get them to stop. He insists that he means them no harm.
	- He aided the [[Amethyst Academy]] for a time to get into the city, but that soon turned when he did not wish to share some of the knowledge he had gained.
	- [[River]] most likely won't come to see him willingly. She likely doesn't have fond memories of him. 
	- He sends [[Grunt]] to fetch a case of wine while catching up with [[Sihrr]].
	- He offers a tour to [[Sihrr]].
- Meanwhile...
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to go through a door in the house, and is frozen in place. She is incapable of moving and feels magnetically stuck to the door.
- Back to [[Silas]]. The attention span of the creatures is not indefinite, some go back to their tasks.
	- The creatures here appear to be stable. Nobody eats or drinks, but nobody seems to be decomposing or mutating any further. They are consistently unpacking and touching delerium without issue.
	- [[Silas]] notices that none of the creatures go into the back corner. He uncovers a hatch in the back corner.
	- He opens and descends about 10 feet into some sort of unpleasant smelling cavern. There are a few torches lighting the way.
- [[Sihrr]] is shown around, he notices a map on the wall that depicts the [[Inscruitable Tower]].
	- The [[Pale Man]] mentions he hasn't let another soul inside the room in years.
	- There is something in the city that is corrupting those within it. He explains he has a way of fixing it, to remove contamination from creatures. He can cure it, help those grotesquely transformed to regain some of their original sanity and abilities. He said he could have cured some of the haze creatures entirely, but it's useful at times to keep some around. Some of the creatures were those that attempted to rob him in the past, and now serve him.
	- He has no intention of curing the creatures with him. He speaks that he has reached an amount of power that is almost godlike. To finish what he needs, he needs to get access to the [[Inscruitable Tower]]. It is in a very dangerous part of the city, even for him. He finds it difficult to travel the city unnoticed.
	- He says he has gifts for [[Sihrr]]. 
	- He wants to harness the power from the contamination and control it. 
	- He offers if [[Sihrr]] can bring the queen to him, he may be able to cure her or something similar.
	- He says that [[Sihrr]] is welcome back, but there are some rooms that he is not allowed to enter without the [[Pale Man]] escorting him.
- [[Silas]] begins to wander the caverns.
	- Add a candle and a vial to my inventory
	- He walks down a path, finds stairs towards the house presumably, then turns back as he does not have an invitation.
- The Steward's seal of Drakkenheim, is one of a set of 6 items made by the Amythyst Academy and the Clergy of the Sacred Flame.
