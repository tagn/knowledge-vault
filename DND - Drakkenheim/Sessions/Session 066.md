## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up with Grannie about to go down, Milando just made a deal with Keth to spare Grannie.
- Keth gets sucked into the bag. Silas also gets sucked into the bag. The ghostly hand seems to be on the end of a tongue. 
- Sihrr opens the bag with telekinesis and flips the bag over to get us out. Arken has to help Silas get out the rest of the way as the creatures tongue grabs him.
- Arken and Sihrr go look for the head of Grannie as it floated down the river.
- Milando came in/out via a summoning circle thingy at Grannies house.
- We slowly make our way into Grannies house. The house smells of decay and rotting wood.
- Silas casts identify on the Pestle. It's a Natural weapon. Does bludgeoning damage and can cause the target have to make a save or get disadvantage on concentration checks.
- Inside grannies house we find:
	- The phylactery of saint vitruvio. It's under a pile of discarded items in the corner of the room.
	- An amulet with a mirror in it.
	- Two hobgoblin feet that are stuck together at the soles.
	- A magical ring. Plain silver.
	- A severed arm of a troll.
	- A severed head of a water elemental, a marid.
	- A long iron needle.
	- A pointed bone tube.
	- An eye that constantly looks around. The lid never closes.
	- A glass spider.
	- A deck of 22 playing cards.
	- A large black box, about three feet deep, a foot wide.
- Arken finds a small rock with a hole in it, he can always hear wind from it.
- Silas finds a small pocket mirror that is perfect, whenever he picks it up it fogs over.
- Sihrr finds a small skull of a rabbit that whispers insults when nobody is looking at it.
- Keth finds a spinning top with an image of one of the four elements on each side.
- There is evidence that someone else has been sleeping in the area.
- Silas grabs some mystery hair from where he used to sleep. He finds a small envelope. Inside is a letter scrawled, "To my dearest grandson. If you are reading this. I have passed into the shadows. The cauldron is yours, guard it well. Be wary of those who come seeking it. It will bring sweet lies. In the hollow key of the riverbank, the one eyed witch still owes her a favor. The forest remembers and will answer your call."
