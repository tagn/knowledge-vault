## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- The group has crossed the river
- Perception check
	- Can see [[Castle Drakkenheim]] a bit better now, we're relatively certain we see things flying around it
	- Streets/buildings are in better condition on this side
- We start searching for the inn into the city on the north side of the river
- We hear laughing and whatnot as we approach the inn. Building looks pristine as we creep up
- Three story inn, beautiful spire, built of black wood
- Building seems out of place, everything around it is destroyed but this looks like the style of 20 years prior, like as if it wasn't damaged.
- Building gives off no magic, no good/evil detected
- We enter, about 35 patrons inside, we are the worst looking people in this room. It's dimly lit by candles
- [[Keth]] tries to bring someone outside and there are suddenly people outside
- "5:40PM" is two hours from now, but last we checked it was like 9:30AM

- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] dashes down the stairs, out the front door, darts around the corner outside
- [[Keth]] goes into the kitchen and vomits in a bucket
- [[Arken]] gets walked down stairs by the knight guy
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] identifies a heating stone he swiped from the room, god fucking damnit
- The guy that walked [[Arken]] out can't seem to remember where they came from and seems visibly confused
- [[Keth]] scouts out rooms around the kitchen
- [[Arken]] goes in and tries to disrupt the music with his echo

- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] goes back up and finds keys on a body, heads back down and unlocks the door to the cellar
- We find a staircase back up into the inn
- We pick a door open, then find a room full of "smugglers"
- They turn surprised and look at us, [[Keth]] says "looks like a good poker game in here"
- It's about 6:30PM when we leave off.
