## Summary

## Event Log

- We decide to go speak with Ryan Greymere about access to the [[Inscruitable Tower]] to see if she can help us get in, and what information she has about it.
- We successfully convince Ryan Greymere to aid us in entering the tower if we successfully clear the grounds.
- She wants possession of the Inscruitable Staff, which was in possession of the previous Archmage, who is presumed dead.
- Ryan Greymere invites us into the Rose Theatre after we come to an agreement.
- Circular open air auditorium. A circular stage with a wooden platform at the north of the room. There is some sort of back stage area. In the center is a large Delerium Geode which seems to be what she uses to power the place.
- Ryan Greymere wants to "seal the city and farm the resources".
