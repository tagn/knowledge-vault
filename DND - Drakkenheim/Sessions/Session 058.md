## Summary

## Event Log

- We decide to go speak with Ryan Greymere about access to the [[Inscruitable Tower]] to see if she can help us get in, and what information she has about it.
- We successfully convince Ryan Greymere to aid us in entering the tower if we successfully clear the grounds.
- She wants possession of the Inscruitable Staff, which was in possession of the previous Archmage, who is presumed dead.
