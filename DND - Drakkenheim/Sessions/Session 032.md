## Summary

## Event Log

- I am rock.
- The group wanders about looking for [[Seven]].
- They consider some options for who to go talk to to figure out if this can be fixed.
- They bring [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] back to the house to see if she can fix [[Seven]].
- They inquire and learn that maybe [[Eoghan]] can fix it, and learn that perhaps the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] may be able to help.
- The pluck off a bunch of berries and offer one to [[Flamekeeper Hannah]]. The bush grows new berries.
- They consider if they should go to Aldor. He doesn't have a scroll, but he does have a potion that *should* cure petrification.
- They spend 2000 gold on the potion.
- They pour the jar of mayonnaise onto [[Seven]]. He comes back to normal and tries to figure out what's going on.
- We discuss how to handle the watch over the [[Hooded Lanterns]] and [[Ironhelm]] dwarves.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] gets a sending one day from [[Milando]] and he asks if everyone is okay.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] heads by himself over to the watchtower to inquire about work.
- [[Ansom Lang]] tells him they've recently had a problem with another group of adventurers ambushing patrols in the city.  They call themselves the "Iconics" now, but we believe them to be the "Favored Few".
- We go looking for them, they don't seem home. We wait outside for a bit.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] gets a message from what we assume to be the female dwarf that it's not nice to wait on someone's porch unannounced.
- We break in, nobody is home. Leave them a note that we might be allies.
- We get home, on our door there is a note from the Iconics saying "We know where you live too, don't get any ideas."
- Scouting for the dwarves, it looks like around three times a day a group of dwarves/hooded lanterns move in or out of the city
	- Around 6AM a group of hooded lanterns and dwarves are outbound. Roughly 15 people. 
	- Around 3PM a group comes back from the scar.
	- Once in two days, a group came back around 10PM.
