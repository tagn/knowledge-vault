## Event Log

- We rest in the Cathedral, then return to see Ryan Greymere at the Rose Theatre.
- As we're arriving, we watch an incredibly large mansion blink out of space inside of the dome.
- We venture over to the Inscrutable tower, taking note that there should be a teleportation circle inscribed in front of the tower.
