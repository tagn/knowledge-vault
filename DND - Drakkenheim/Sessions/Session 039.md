## Summary

## Event Log


- We pick up a discussion in our house about next steps.
- We call 1-800-talk-to-the-queen to discuss the Scar.
- We plan to head over to the Hendrick's farm to get an idea of what the people look like
- There are less people at the farm than we usually see. We check to see if Nathaniel is home and his home seems empty. We head over towards the barn to see if anyone has.
- We've informed members of leadership have been called into the city on urgent business.
- Good day, I'm an acquaintance of your fellow Arken heard they were called. Do they require assistance?
- Nathaniel Flint - got his full name
- Silas receives a heavy psychic backlash after attempting to send a message.
- These Falling Flame individuals are heathens. How dare they attack me for simply attempting contact.
- Silas does a wee bit of bloodletting to get rid of his migraine after that message. Much better.
- There is a sign at the site where Aldor's cart was. It's saying coming soon with some new magical purveyor named "Vil".
	- Sihrr notices a shimmer around the sign.
- Silas attempts to give one of the children a tooth, but he is denied. He asks Keth for a favor to try to plant it on the cart.
- We go shopping to find Silas a bed. He wants a nice four post bed.
- Keth attempts to swindle Mr. Crow for some studded leather
- We make our way into Drakkenheim towards the Scar, and fail an encounter check.
- A bed tries to bite my ass. I take a short vacation, then come back to beat the furniture to death.
- We continue towards the camp at the Scar.
- Arken dresses up like a pilgrim, Silas disguises himself as Nathaniel.
- We see some hulking creature. We don't think it's really been doing anything.
- We're told to leave the area.
	- Silas counts at least 3 chained up haze hulks, 1 hooded lantern looking fella, at least one dwarf with a rifle. We assume more are in the camp.
		- At least 5 dwarves
		- Roughly a dozen hooded lanterns
		- At least 3 haze hulks chained up, possibly 4.
- Keth does what Keth does best. Go in solo to scout and hope for the best.
