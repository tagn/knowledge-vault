## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- [[Arken]] finds a letter from [[River]] nailed to a board in front of his house. He reads it and she is offering a lucrative deal after "speaking" with the corpse we brought back.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] finds a letter from the [[Hooded Lanterns]] nailed to a post in front of our house.
	- To my trustworthy friends - I think it is time that we get introduced to the lord commander himself, he has a mission that requires some sets of skills that it may be best to be outsourced. Please come to the watchtower at your earliest convenience. 
- We intend to head over to talk to [[River]], sell some [[Delerium]], see about what quest she has to offer
- We see [[River]] sitting without her body guard
	- The [[Amethyst Academy]] wants to make a move in the city that she can't make on her own
	- There is a group of dwarves in the town mining - known as the [[Ironhelms]]
	- [[Amethyst Academy]] wants to buy the [[Delerium]], but they won't sell it to them.
	- They want us to break up on the contract that they have with whatever faction.
	- They'll pay market rate. They'll pay all expenses. They must cut ties with whomever they are working with.
	- They'll work out some kind of fair compensation for us
- We sell the 5 [[Delerium]] Fragments to River for 500 gold, handed over in an egg carton
- Group heads to talk to the [[Hooded Lanterns]] about another task
	- They need a steady supply of more advanced weaponry
	- They also want us to go to [[The Scar]] to deal with a dwarven expedition, the [[Ironhelms]]
	- They want the weaponry from these people
	- Dwarves have a smithy at [[The Scar]]
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] goes off on his own to try to find Lyrian
	- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] lets her touch the gun
	- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] pulls out a notepad and starts scribbling what [[Lyrian]] tells him about what kind of ammo to get. She recommends talking to [[Gertrude Ironhelm]].
- We attempt to discuss who to help at this point
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] doesn't want to force anything on the dwarves, they should get to make their own decision
- We fail a random encounter roll and trigger event: 65 (of 100) and also roll 1 (4)
	- We're walking through a portion of [[Drakkenheim]]
	- [[Keth]] gets caught on a thick ass spider web
	- Blue and white spiders, shimmering
- We fight them, fuck they hit hard.
- [[Keth]] goes down, [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] gets her back up. She is poisoned and paralyzed.
- We made it to [[Buckle Down Row]]
- [[Keth]] goes up to see [[Rose Carver]] to complete our quest with the Black Ivory Inn
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] finds a table to sit at to work on his "business cards"
	- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] is making "Customer Loyalty Cards" to give to [[Armin Gainsbury]] for his business
- [[Arken]] attempts to get [[Rose Carver]] to tell us where the tunnels go - She doesn't want to say right now, maybe eventually we will know.
- [[Slaughter Stone Square]] - This is where the tunnel leads. "Some people still say [[the executioner]] occupies the plaza, not something we want to mess with, it's killed more adventurers/etc.. in the last 15 or 20 years." We can use the tunnel, but need to be extra careful to not get caught by that creature.
- [[Keth]] flashes the card that was stuck to our door to [[Rose Carver]]
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] gets dragged back outside with the crowd. Someone tries to mess with the spider and doesn't believe he owns it. He starts to poke a knife at its joints and [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] tells it to web him.
- [[Blackjack Mel]] comes in and talks to [[Keth]] about the card. He instructs [[Rose Carver]] "Will you get the mirror?". He taps the mirror with a ring and inside of the mirror a hooded female figure appears. [[Rose Carver]] leaves the bar.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] continues to miss every important discussion of the session.
- The group is told the [[Hooded Lanterns]] have been meddling in the affairs of the [[Queen's Men]].
- "It's time we showed them they aren't in charge of the city. I have a little package that I would like delivered to the gate the [[Hooded Lanterns]] control. Nothing explosive. If we can sneak it in with another delivery she can make it worth our while, possibly she will owe us a favor. Here's the second part of this. When the fallout from this happens, she doesn't care if we have to kill a couple of her (the queen's men) guys to get in bed with the [[Hooded Lanterns]]. When the [[Hooded Lanterns]] find the package, it will lead them to some people that she doesn't care about, and it might get us into them. She advises Keth to not fuck her on this, or the little one will get it."
- "I've heard that sometimes you run up debts that you cannot pay" - [[Queen's Men]] leader says to [[Keth]]. "Don't worry, [[Vattix]] can't reach you inside this city. His agents can't reach you here". [[Keth]] is threatened by her that maybe he'll let this guy in to reclaim his debt from [[Keth]]. We have a fortnight to get the job done. If we don't get it done then it will be considered a failure. 
- The [[Ironhelms]] pay 15% of their take as a protection fee. Money is given directly to the [[Queen of Blades]].
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] webs a guy outside, then tries to tie his shoes together, but he's too poor to be humiliated.
- We leave off unsure of what to do next. We need to come up with some sort of plan on how to deal with the Dwarves.
