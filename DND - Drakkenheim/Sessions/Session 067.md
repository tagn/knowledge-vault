## Summary

## Event Log

- We talk to the flesh bag with telepathic bond, it's real hungry and wants to eat some people. We satiate it with a good berry.
- We gift the deck of many things to Lady Frostgleam
- We're returned to Drakkenheim, at Champion's Gate. It's a skeleton crew, no planar are here, some tents are around.
- We make our way to the Cathedral, 2-3 miles out we run into a barricade set up by the Falling Fire members.
- We are allowed through to go see Lucretia.
- The area around the Cathedral has been leveled to make the area more defensible.
