## Session Event Log

- We take a short rest in a not great location, but we're safe
- Will identifies his items and attunes to the spider
- We come up to the river
	- Smells sickly and sour
	- Water level is about 4 feet below the sea wall
- Across the river, looks like the city was leveled by a tornado for the most part. Some buildings seem to be standing well. There is a low, wafting steam floating above the water.
