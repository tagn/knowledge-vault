## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We take a short rest in a not great location, but we're safe
- Will identifies his items and attunes to the spider
- We come up to the river
	- Smells sickly and sour
	- Water level is about 4 feet below the sea wall
- Across the river, looks like the city was leveled by a tornado for the most part. Some buildings seem to be standing well. There is a low, wafting steam floating above the water.
- Arken notices a "river pourpice fin" crest the water
- We scout for any sort of dock/marina/boats/etc..
- A rope is still in place, attached to the rope is 
- Arken replaces the rope and tests it out, seems like it might hold some people to cross
- We discuss maybe reinforcing the "raft" to use it to cross
- We walk further up the riverwalk, keth finds a box on a table, looks to be filled with business cards
	- Amandas Outdoor something - "Your Adventure Our Pleasure"
	- Rogan Blum - Black Ivory Inn
	- Specialties in the Spokes - Competitor for Will's families shop
- We continue to walk, but Sihrr looks through the cards for things he knows about
- We fail our encounter check on the way out, following the river up out of drakkenheim
- We reach a park nearly out of the city, Keth is nearly grabbed by a dive bombing manticore
- Water looks a little better up river, but not great, we likely can't just dodge it by going far around it
