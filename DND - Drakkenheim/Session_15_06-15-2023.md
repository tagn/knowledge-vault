## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We walk into a "smugglers den" under the Black Ivory Inn, and we're confronted by a group of allegedly smugglers
- We bounce out of that situation and head back upstairs
- Anika - Knight of the silver order that was protecting Ms. Charlotte
- Mage in purple robe - No name known
- Father Adamos - Missing priest
- Will tries to get information about the chef, he realizes everyone is just dead in the inn and he bolts to run
- Everyone seems confused where they came from
	- We're stuck and can't get out, slowly forgetting everything
- Meteor strikes, we get blasted off the balcony, a wall collapses on us, we all die.
- Arken and Will have no memory of what happened.
- Will is restored, has his hand back, looks like he would have 15 years ago?
