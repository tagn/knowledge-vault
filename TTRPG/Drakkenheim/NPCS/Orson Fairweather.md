## Summary:

**Orson Fairweather** is a merchant based out of **Caravan Park** near Emberwood Village, known primarily for his potential supply of **gems**. While he doesn’t play a large narrative role (at least not yet), he’s considered a possible resource for acquiring magical components or trade goods—likely relevant for spellcasters or crafting purposes.

## Significant Events:

- Mentioned by **Armin Gainsbury** as someone who **might have a supply of gems**—this was part of a broader conversation about sourcing magical materials or spell components​.
    
- His name came up during early logistical planning by the party while seeking out tools and items needed to explore deeper into Drakkenheim.
    
- There's no direct interaction with Orson detailed in the logs yet, which suggests he is still more of a lead than an actively engaged NPC.

## Faction Associations:
