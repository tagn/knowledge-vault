## Summary:

**Grandmother** is a powerful, ancient **hag** who resided in a corrupted domain within the **Feywild**. For over a century, she maintained total control over **Silas**, your party member, who served her under coercive magical influence. She operated from a decaying house in a land devoid of life—surrounded by charm-based enchantments, servants, and monstrous guardians. Her pact with Silas was **abusive**, manipulative, and sustained through emotional and magical binding. After Silas **defied her**, she severed ties violently, prompting your party to **invade the Feywild**, confront her, and ultimately **slay her** to break the bond and retrieve a stolen artifact.

Grandmother wasn’t just a hag—she was **a living trauma, a warlock’s prison, and a manipulative abuser disguised as “family.”** Her magic wasn’t just arcane—it was personal, insidious, and deeply rooted in emotional control. Killing her wasn’t just a mission. It was a **rescue**. A reckoning. And maybe, just maybe, the start of Silas being truly free.

## Significant Events:

- Grandmother was first introduced through **Silas’s backstory**, as a controlling figure who **dictated much of his early life**, influencing his magic and decisions​.
    
- When the party ventured into the **Feywild**, you negotiated with **Lady Frostgleam**, who granted you the **Boon of Radiant Clarity** in exchange for your promise to kill Grandmother​.
    
- Grandmother **psychically contacted Silas in dreams**, threatening to send for him, signaling her grip wasn’t broken yet​.
    
- Her domain was a lifeless, decayed forest, patrolled by corrupted beasts and riddled with her manipulative magic. You fought your way through these defenses, including a **salamander-like monster and wolves**, to reach her home​.
    
- In her house, **Milando**—the recurring fiendish enemy—was found enthroned inside a binding circle, making a **deal with Keth** for her freedom. The party rejected this, and a **massive battle ensued**​.
    
- During the fight, both **Silas and Keth were trapped inside a bag of devouring-like creature**, but were freed by clever use of **telekinesis** and teamwork​.
    
- After killing her, you **searched her lair** and recovered numerous **twisted magical relics**, including:
    
    - The **Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio**
        
    - A **Pestle weapon**
        
    - A variety of cursed, grotesque, or bizarre magical items (Orphan Feet, the Iron Needle, the Glass Spider, and a **Deck of Many Things**)​.
        
- Her true name is revealed to be **Nivra Chillheart**, and her defeat earned you the **respect of the local fey**, including a procession of deer who bowed in reverence​.
    
- Silas later found a **final letter** from her after the fight—cryptic and manipulative even in death—confirming that the trauma she inflicted lingers​.
