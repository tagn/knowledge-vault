## Summary:

**Renard** is the charismatic and confident leader of the **Gentlemen Bastards**, an independent adventuring company based out of **Emberwood Village**. He presents himself as suave, clever, and well-connected, with a flair for theatrics and diplomacy. Renard often acts as the spokesperson for his group, which includes **Lyrian** (an elven ranger) and **Grummish** (a scholarly bugbear). He embodies the “charming rival” archetype—sometimes ally, sometimes competitor, always with a grin and a bet on the table.

## Significant Events:

- **First introduced at the Bark & Buzzard Tavern**, where Renard makes a **wager** with the party over who can retrieve the largest piece of **Delirium** from Drakkenheim. This initial encounter establishes the Gentlemen Bastards as friendly rivals​.
    
- During the encounter with a **Haze Hulk**, Renard and his group **intervene**, but not necessarily to save the party—more as opportunists testing the waters. His group initially creates suspicion, especially after **Keth Darklighter’s** death, but tensions de-escalate​.
    
- Later conversations reveal that Renard values **professional camaraderie**, and even offers information or insight when it suits him. He seems well-informed and possibly more connected than he lets on.
    
- The party notes that Renard may have ties to various factions, but he remains **pointedly neutral**, choosing not to align the Gentlemen Bastards with any of the big players like the **Hooded Lanterns**, **Queen’s Men**, or **Amethyst Academy**.
