## Summary:

**Old Zoya** is a reclusive and enigmatic healer who resides at the **Shrine of the Old Gods**, north of Emberwood Village. She is not aligned with the dominant religious factions like the Falling Fire, but instead represents a more ancient and possibly druidic or pagan faith. Her power seems substantial—she's one of the few people capable of treating **Delirium contamination**, a service that even seasoned factions struggle to offer. While aloof and blunt, Zoya is not hostile—she expects respect and reciprocity for her aid.

## Significant Events:

- The party visits **Old Zoya** to seek healing for **Arken Highbloom**, who is suffering from severe Delirium-related contamination​.
    
- Zoya agrees to help but insists Arken must come to her personally, emphasizing her autonomy and old-school methods.
    
- When the party pushes Arken to visit her, he initially refuses, but later does go to her shrine after worsening symptoms.
    
- **Cleansing service costs 250 gold**, showing that her help isn’t charity—it’s transactional, but effective.
    
- Zoya is later confirmed to be one of the only people who **successfully purged corruption** from **Wyldenten Proudsky**, making her services valuable and unique.
    
- She also offers vague but ominous spiritual insight, reinforcing her position as a powerful, semi-mystic figure outside the mainstream faction politics.

## Faction Associations:

- **Shrine of the Old Gods**: Zoya is its primary resident and spiritual authority. This shrine worships forgotten or primal deities, distinct from the meteor-worshipping Falling Fire church or any institutional powers.
    
- While not overtly hostile to any faction, Zoya is clearly **independent** and suspicious of the **Amethyst Academy**, **Sacred Flame**, and other centralized authorities. She doesn't seem to want anything to do with their power plays.
    
- Respected (possibly feared) by those in the know—she is clearly not to be trifled with.
