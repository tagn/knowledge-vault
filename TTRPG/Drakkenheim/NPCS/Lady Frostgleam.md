## Summary:

**Lady Frostgleam** is a **Crystal Dragon** and the **caretaker of a protected domain within the Feywild**. A rare and benevolent presence in a realm often defined by chaos and danger, she acts as a powerful and enigmatic ally. Her territory is one of **tranquility and arcane beauty**, in stark contrast to the rotting influence of Grandmother nearby. While not overtly invested in mortal affairs, she recognized the significance of your group’s mission and extended both **guidance** and **boons** to aid you. Lady Frostgleam embodies the ancient wisdom and reserved power typical of dragonkind—but with an unmistakably kind streak.

## Significant Events:

- Upon arriving in the Feywild, your party made contact with Lady Frostgleam, who welcomed you **into her crystalline forest**. She offered food, rest, and a calm place to prepare for the confrontation with Grandmother​.
    
- She was the one who gave the party the **Boon of Radiant Clarity**—a potent Fey gift—on the condition that you would **kill Grandmother**, an entity she clearly considered dangerous and corrosive to the Feywild’s balance​.
    
- After the hag’s defeat, you were met by **a line of fey deer who bowed before you**, parting to grant safe passage into Frostgleam’s territory—a symbolic and literal gesture of respect​.
    
- She **flew the party on her back** (in dragon form) into a **hidden, illusion-shrouded mountain**, which served as her lair and sanctuary​.
    
- Within her home, she offered you **rooms, safety, and magical rewards**, including a **legendary Ioun Stone of Mastery**. She left gifts in drawers and hosted you until she could **send you back to the material plane**​.
    
- You entrusted her with a **Deck of Many Things**, suggesting a high level of trust between your party and her, as well as her unique capacity to safely handle such powerful artifacts​.
    
- Silas also entrusted her with **a key and letter left behind by Grandmother**, closing the loop on that chapter of his life with her blessing​.
