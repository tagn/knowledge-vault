## Summary:

Keith is a minor NPC encountered early in the campaign as part of a bandit ambush led by the group known as the **Queen's Men**. He became notable—and somewhat infamous—due to his memorable reaction during a fight, where he ran away after the party killed his lover. Despite being a minor bandit, Keith humorously became an ongoing joke among players as potentially being the "Big Bad" villain behind larger plots, even though there's no actual evidence of him having significant power or influence.
