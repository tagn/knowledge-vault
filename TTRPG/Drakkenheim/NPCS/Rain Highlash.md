## Summary:

**Rain Highlash** is a **Sergeant** in the **Hooded Lanterns**, a loyal and disciplined officer stationed at the **Watchtower** near Emberwood Village. He serves under the command of **Petra Lang** and ultimately **Elias Drexel**, the Lanterns’ overall commander. Rain appears to be a straight-laced, by-the-book soldier who helps handle initial contacts with adventurers and travelers entering the city. He seems competent, cautious, and clearly dedicated to the Lanterns’ mission of reclaiming Drakkenheim from chaos.

## Significant Events:

- **First Encounter**: Rain greets the party during their initial visit to the Watchtower. He provides them with basic intelligence and warnings about the city, including which areas to avoid—particularly **the walls and gates**, which are highly dangerous due to the Haze and monsters beyond them​.
    
- Present when the group meets **Petra Lang**, offering context and tactical insight. He does not overstep her authority but plays the role of a capable subordinate.
    
- Rain helps orient the party to the **Fourth Provisional Expeditionary Force**—the formal name of the Hooded Lanterns—and emphasizes the group's loyalty to the fallen monarchy and their mission to **destroy all Delirium** and retake the city​.
    
- No notable corruption, secrets, or double-dealing are associated with him so far—he seems to be one of the few honest NPCs in a city full of shifting agendas.
