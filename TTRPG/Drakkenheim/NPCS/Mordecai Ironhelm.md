## Summary:

**Mordecai Ironhelm** is one of the Ironhelm dwarves operating out of **The Smithy** in **The Scar**, a fortified Delerium mining and weapons manufacturing site. He is the brother of **Gertrude** and **Eloise Ironhelm**, and part of a skilled dwarven clan that maintains a significant presence in Drakkenheim’s chaos. Mordecai appears to be one of the clan’s more diplomatic voices and plays a leadership role when interacting with outsiders. He is pragmatic, focused on survival and trade, and open to negotiation under the right conditions.

## Significant Events:

- Present during the party's **night watch shift at The Smithy**, helping coordinate the dwarves' defenses and operations​.
    
- During a combat encounter with a **Haze Hulk Juggernaut** and waves of corrupted creatures, Mordecai actively helps organize the defense. He is later **shot with arrows by Garmyr attackers**, disrupting a conversation mid-sentence—demonstrating that despite his diplomatic bent, he is directly in harm’s way​.
    
- Following the Garmyr attack, **the dwarves, with Mordecai included**, begin discussions with the party and the **Hooded Lanterns** about a protection deal. Mordecai’s presence reinforces his role as a key decision-maker within the Ironhelm faction​.

## Faction Associations:

- **Ironhelm Dwarves**: Core member of the Ironhelm family who run mining and smithing operations at The Smithy in The Scar. The Ironhelms are known for crafting weapons and harvesting Delerium.
    
- **Tense relationship with the Church of the Falling Fire**: Ironhelms have clashed violently with members of the church, allegedly killing pilgrims who approached their camp without warning. While the Ironhelms claim it was in defense of their operations, tensions with the Church are high​.
    
- **Potential alignment with the Hooded Lanterns**: The Ironhelms, including Mordecai, show openness to partnering with the Lanterns in exchange for security and better trade routes. A deal is eventually brokered between the factions after party mediation​.
    
- **Previously under "protection" from the Queen's Men**, who were taking a cut of their profits. However, the Ironhelms have grown more confident in their fortifications and seem ready to cut ties with them​.
