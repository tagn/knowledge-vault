## Summary:

**Eldrich Runeweaver** is a **high-ranking member of the Amethyst Academy**. He is a powerful wizard, politically savvy, and one of the key representatives of the Academy in inter-faction dealings. He is almost never seen alone—frequently accompanied by a **Simulacrum of himself** and a **Homunculus**, both of which serve to protect him and give him more control over his appearances and influence. While he represents the Academy’s interests, Eldrich’s tone and approach suggest he is **not particularly concerned with diplomacy** or subtlety. He’s a reminder that the Academy is ruled by powerful individuals—not faceless bureaucracy.

## Significant Events:

- **Appears during the Cathedral summit** attended by all major faction leaders (Lucretia, Elias Drexel, Theodore Marshall, Queen of Blades). He shows up with **River**, his **Simulacrum**, and **a Homunculus**, showcasing his magical prowess and paranoia. This is a moment of intense political friction, and his presence cements the Academy’s involvement at the highest levels of Drakkenheim’s fate​.
    
- **Later meets privately with Lucretia and the Queen’s Men** for additional negotiations or influence-setting—suggesting he’s maneuvering behind the scenes for whatever the Academy’s endgame is​.
    
- **Assists your party by transporting you to the Feywild**, which shows a surprising moment of cooperation—but it’s transactional. He was convinced, not generous​.
    
- The group shares **intelligence with Ryan Greymere** regarding Eldrich’s knowledge, implying he’s involved in the deeper workings of the Academy’s internal politics and the mysterious **Inscrutable Tower**​.

## Faction Associations:

- **Amethyst Academy**: Eldrich is a central pillar in the Academy’s operations in Drakkenheim—likely one of the highest-ranking mages still active in the city. His presence at faction summits, use of high-level magic, and command of River indicate immense authority.
    
- **Works with River**, though the hierarchy between them is murky. She might act as his operative or subordinate. At the very least, he trusts her enough to keep her close in public.
    
- **Power broker**: Interacts directly with faction leaders like Lucretia and the Queen of Blades. The fact that the Queen even treats with him implies he’s one of the few outsiders she respects—or at least fears.
