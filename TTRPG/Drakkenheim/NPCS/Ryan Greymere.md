## Summary:

**Ryan Greymere**, better known by her moniker **the Iron Banshee**, is a **renegade archmage** operating independently within Drakkenheim. She is the **self-appointed mistress of the Rose Theatre**, which she has fortified with powerful arcane wards and a massive Delirium geode as its power source. Although associated with the **Amethyst Academy**, she is not tightly aligned with its central leadership—operating more as a **rogue academic** with her own agenda and access to forgotten or forbidden magical knowledge. She is extremely powerful, highly pragmatic, and one of the few individuals capable of understanding and interacting with the **Inscrutable Tower** on a meaningful level.

## Significant Events:

- Initially approached by your party regarding **Milando’s demand for Hazewalker Plate**. Ryan was **dismissive and mocking** of Milando, making it clear she’s not easily intimidated—even by fiends​.
    
- She revealed that she **created the Hazewalker Plate herself**, implying unique expertise in Delirium-based magic item crafting.
    
- Granted the party **conditional access to the Inscrutable Tower**, offering help in return for the **Inscrutable Staff**, once held by the former Archmage​.
    
- Opened up the **Rose Theatre**, a circular auditorium fortified with magic, as both a base and a research facility. The theatre functions as a **power node**, drawing energy from a central Delirium geode​.
    
- She divulged extensive information on the **nature of Delirium**, including:
    
    - Its dimensional origins.
        
    - The relationship between magic and the Haze.
        
    - The possibility that unchecked growth of Delirium could consume the world within 200 years.
        
    - Her own plan: to **seal the city and farm the Delirium** for sustainable magic use​.
        
- Provided aid to **Silas**, helping him revert back into a Sea Elf form​.
    
- Created and gifted a **magical token of protection**—a writ stating that the bearer is under the protection of the Archmage of Drakkenheim​.
    
- Assisted with access to various areas of the **Inscrutable Tower**, particularly the **Spellforge** and its other arcane research spaces.
    
- Her absence from the Rose Theatre at one point was noted as a **potential failure point for maintaining the protective barrier**, showing how crucial she is to the stability of the magical zone​.

## Faction Associations:

- **Loosely aligned with the Amethyst Academy**, but very much an **independent operator**. Her title of "Archmage of Drakkenheim" may be self-bestowed or based on a former Academy rank, but she doesn’t follow Eldrich Runeweaver’s chain of command.
    
- Engages diplomatically with **your party**, despite your mixed relationship with the Academy. She’s proven **willing to cooperate** where interests align.
    
- **Respected (or at least not challenged) by the Queen’s Men**—her territory is left untouched, and she occasionally shares information with them.
    
- Viewed with **wariness by other factions**, particularly the Hooded Lanterns and the Church of the Falling Fire, who would likely see her ambitions and Delirium usage as dangerous or heretical.
