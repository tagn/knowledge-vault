## Summary:

**Rita** is a **retired assassin** with a brutal reputation—once one of the most notorious killers in Drakkenheim’s criminal underworld. Now, she appears to be semi-retired and spending her time in **Buckle Down Row**, specifically frequenting bars affiliated with the **Queen's Men**. Despite her outwardly calm or pleasant demeanor, Rita commands **deep respect and fear**. She’s the kind of person you’re warned to “mind your manners” around, and with good reason. Even in retirement, her presence is enough to intimidate hardened criminals.

## Significant Events:

- Rita is first encountered in the **Sweaty Bugbear**, a rough criminal bar that serves as the hangout for the **Howling Dogs** gang. Keth is explicitly told to be polite around her, suggesting her reputation precedes her​.
    
- It’s revealed that **Rita was one of the most infamous assassins** in the city before stepping out of that life. Whether she actually left it behind is... debatable​.
    
- Later, at **Sneaky McGee’s Bar**, Rita is shown to wield subtle influence: when one of the party members (**Seven**) forgets to thank her after ordering a drink, he’s **yanked back by the collar**, and it’s made clear that _everyone_ is expected to show her respect—even if she’s just sitting quietly in a bar​.
    
- Her name comes up in the context of various Queen's Men territories and bars, implying she's either a **watchful enforcer** or an **advisor** to current players like **Veronica Venom** or **Blackjack Mel**, if not still working in the shadows herself.

## Faction Associations:

- **Queen’s Men**: Strongly associated with them, though her exact rank or role is unclear. She’s definitely not a grunt—Rita has the aura of a **retired mob enforcer who still has a seat at the table**.
    
- Seen within **Buckle Down Row**, an area heavily controlled by Queen’s Men gangs and their affiliates (such as **Pins & Clubs**, **Rose and Thorns**, and the **Howling Dogs**).
    
- Likely answers directly to, or is at least in the trusted circle of, the **Queen of Blades**, though this isn’t confirmed outright.
