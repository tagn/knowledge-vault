## Summary:

**Lyrian** is an elven ranger and a member of the adventuring party known as the **Gentlemen Bastards**. She is depicted as a competent, stealthy, and potentially deadly figure within the group, often flanking or taking tactical positions. Lyrian travels alongside **Renard** (the leader) and **Grummish** (a bugbear), forming a trio of frequent adventurers in and out of Drakkenheim. She maintains a cool and professional demeanor and appears to be highly capable in the field.

## Significant Events:

- First introduced with the rest of the **Gentlemen Bastards** during a tavern scene in **Emberwood Village**, where they meet the party and make a friendly wager about who can retrieve the largest piece of **Delirium**​.
    
- Later ambushed or ambushes the party near a haze hulk incident — her eagle leads the team to where **Keth Darklighter’s** body lies after a sniper-style shot, suggesting she had eyes on them or at least reconnaissance in the area. It's unclear whether she was directly involved in the attack, but she demonstrates considerable skill at range.
    
- After a tense encounter involving a haze hulk and potential crossfire, the **Gentlemen Bastards** and the party reconcile, sharing information and seemingly reaching an uneasy truce.
    
- **Wyldenten Proudsky** later seeks Lyrian out for help identifying or finding ammunition for his specialized arquebus. She shows genuine expertise, gives technical guidance, and suggests speaking to **Gertrude Ironhelm** for further help​. This positions her as not only a combatant but someone with knowledge of weapons or magical gear.

## Faction Associations:

- While not overtly tied to a political faction like the **Queen’s Men**, **Hooded Lanterns**, or **Amethyst Academy**, the **Gentlemen Bastards** maintain their own independence and influence, acting as neutral but professional adventurers.
