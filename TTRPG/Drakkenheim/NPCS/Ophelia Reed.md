## Summary:

**Ophelia Reed** is the **High Flamekeeper** of the **Church of Saint Ardenna**, and a prominent leader within the **Falling Fire** faith. She holds substantial religious authority and is clearly a powerful divine caster or figure of importance within her church. She is associated with heavy magical artifacts, militant discipline, and spiritual judgment, and appears to be a key player in managing the fallout from Delirium contamination among her followers.

## Significant Events:

- **First encountered at the Chapel of Saint Ardenna**, where she is seen surrounded by **four heavily armored knights and warhorses** bearing the insignia of the **Knights of the Silver Order**, indicating her high status and importance within religious-militant circles​.
    
- Present when **Flamekeeper Hannah** is pulled aside by **Arken Highbloom** to discuss the Delirium shard embedded in her chest. Ophelia Reed does not intervene directly, but her presence looms, and she’s later observed performing or overseeing religious rites.
    
- She possesses several significant magical items:
    
    - A **censer glowing with strong magical energy**.
        
    - **Metal gloves** clipped to her waist.
        
    - A **small glowing sack**, likely containing a potent relic or spell component​.
        
- While not aggressive, her aura and items suggest readiness to act decisively if faith or order are threatened.

## Faction Associations:

- **Church of the Falling Fire**: She is its **High Flamekeeper**, possibly the highest-ranking cleric or spiritual authority in the region for this religion. The church worships the "star that came"—a reference to the Delirium meteor—and blends apocalypse cult energy with structured doctrine.
    
- **Knights of the Silver Order**: While not explicitly stated as a member, her close proximity and cooperation with the knights suggest a formal alliance or at least mutual respect. The knights act as enforcers or protectors of the church's interests.
