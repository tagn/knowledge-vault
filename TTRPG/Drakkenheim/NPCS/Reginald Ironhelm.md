## Summary:

**Reginald Ironhelm** is a member of the **Ironhelm clan**, a family of dwarves running a fortified smithing and Delirium-mining operation in **The Scar**, known as **The Smithy**. He is described as the **fourth Ironhelm brother**, though he is less prominently featured than siblings like **Gertrude**, **Mordecai**, and **Eloise**. He is involved in administrative or logistical roles—appearing on a receipt for a weapon trade and collaborating on contracts involving ammunition production. His presence reinforces the Ironhelm dwarves' tight-knit and well-organized internal structure.

## Significant Events:

- **Named on a contract** alongside Gertrude for research and ammunition production, specifically tied to **Wyldenten Proudsky’s** custom weapon. This positions Reginald as either a co-signer or co-authority on Ironhelm trades​.
    
- Mentioned when the party visits the Ironhelms at the **Red Lion Hotel** to negotiate terms and understand their operation. He is implied to be one of the dwarves staying at the hotel as part of their shift change from The Smithy​.
    
- Though not heavily spotlighted in combat or diplomacy, Reginald is part of the crew navigating tensions with multiple factions: the **Queen’s Men**, **Church of the Falling Fire**, **Hooded Lanterns**, and the **Amethyst Academy**.

## Faction Associations:

- **Ironhelm Dwarves**: A central figure in the dwarven operation at The Scar. The Ironhelms are independent operators focused on Delirium mining and advanced weapons manufacturing.
    
- Connected indirectly to several factions through Ironhelm diplomacy:
    
    - **Queen’s Men**: Previously extorted the Ironhelms for 15% of their profits.
        
    - **Hooded Lanterns**: Negotiating an alliance for protection and trade.
        
    - **Amethyst Academy**: Tense relationship due to unfulfilled expectations on Delirium supply.
        
    - **Church of the Falling Fire**: Hostile interactions; the Ironhelms reportedly killed pilgrims attempting sabotage.
