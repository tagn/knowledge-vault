## Summary:

**River** is your party’s **initial handler and contact from the Amethyst Academy**, tasked with coordinating field operatives and managing magical recovery efforts in and around Drakkenheim. She’s practical, focused, and often more concerned with results than diplomacy. While she can be helpful, she expects professionalism and delivery on objectives, especially when it comes to recovering Delirium or lost research. River operates with the calculated authority of someone who knows she’s holding arcane firepower just out of reach—and isn't afraid to withhold it if the job’s not done right.

## Significant Events:

- River provides the party with their **initial Academy assignments**, including:
    
    - Investigating the city.
        
    - Tracking down **rogue mages** like **Oscar Yorn**.
        
    - Recovering magical research and Delirium samples​.
        
- She **briefs the party** on high-level targets such as the **Pale Man**, indicating that the Academy has a long and turbulent history with him (he was once part of the Academy before being expelled)​.
    
- **The Pale Man explicitly references River**, claiming he has no grudge but would like a “word” with her—hinting that River may have had a hand in hunting him or stealing from him​.
    
- River’s relationship with the party is **transactional**—she provides missions and expects deliverables. This includes securing relics, research, and even information that may be politically dangerous.
    
- She’s not above **sending adventurers into volatile situations**, but she does so with clear terms and decent compensation—suggesting she’s a bureaucrat, not a puppet master.

## Faction Associations:

- **Amethyst Academy**: River is a **ranking field coordinator or handler**, likely just below the level of senior mages or archmages. She’s a stabilizing force in the Academy’s somewhat fractured presence in the region.
    
- Has access to resources, missions, and internal intelligence, but **not all the secrets**—her knowledge of the Pale Man’s current powers and motives is partial at best.
    
- Cautiously opposed to other major factions like the **Falling Fire** or the **Queen’s Men**, but her primary focus is always on Academy objectives.
