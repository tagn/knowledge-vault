## Summary:

**Milando** is a powerful **Rakshasa**, a fiendish manipulator from the Hells, who first appeared under the guise of a drowish magic merchant. What began as a seemingly innocuous deal—Keth signing an IOU for a magical crossbow—escalated into an ongoing campaign of intimidation, manipulation, and direct threats. Milando is cunning, unpredictable, and always several steps ahead. Although the party has "slain" him, as a Rakshasa, his return from the Hells is not just likely—it's inevitable.

## Significant Events:

- **The Deal**: Keth acquired a magical crossbow from Milando at the Bark & Buzzard tavern, signing an ominous IOU in return​.
    
- **Home Invasion**: Milando began showing up uninvited—once found casually sitting in the party’s house, smoking a pipe and eating cheese, using intimidation to demand Keth retrieve a suit of armor for him​.
    
- **Threats & Pressure**: Sent a death threat letter to Keth, further leveraging his influence over her and the party's direction​.
    
- **Grannie's House Encounter**: Appears via summoning circle at Grannie's house, offers the party a deal to spare her. When refused, he engages in combat. During the fight, he uses a bag-like extradimensional space to try to consume Keth and Silas​.
    
- **Temple Throne**: Later encountered lounging on a throne in a hellish, infernal temple adorned with torment and sigils of Asmodeus. He is confirmed to be a Rakshasa with the classic reverse-palmed hands and an aura that can disable or harm those nearby​.
    
- **Demonic Dream**: Arken dreams of Milando killing Lucretia in a vision, reinforcing the threat he poses and the possibility of his return in more dramatic or destructive form​.

## Faction Associations:

- **None officially stated**, but he is deeply intertwined with infernal/demonic forces and likely aligned with **Asmodeus**, given the architecture and iconography of the temple he resides in.
    
- Operates independently but has shown awareness of and influence over events in Drakkenheim—possibly manipulating factions from behind the scenes.
