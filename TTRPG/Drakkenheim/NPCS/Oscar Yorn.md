## Summary:

**Oscar Yorn** was a brilliant but ethically questionable alchemist and necromancer who formerly studied with the **Amethyst Academy** before going rogue. He took up residence in **Reed Manor**, where he continued his experiments with **Aqua Delirium**, mutated creatures, and strange potions. Though a supplier to the **Hooded Lanterns**, Oscar was also targeted by the **Amethyst Academy**, which viewed him as a threat due to his stolen research and unorthodox practices. Your group was sent to deal with him but failed to make a decisive move—leading to another faction "taking care of" him.

## Significant Events:

- Initially described by **Ansom Lang** of the Hooded Lanterns as a reclusive, eccentric potion supplier who failed to deliver his usual shipments. Some of the potions he did send were **contaminated**​.
    
- He resides in **Reed Manor**, where the party encounters zombie ogres acting as his guards or helpers, reinforcing his ties to necromantic experimentation​.
    
- The party interacted with Oscar multiple times, including buying potions and discovering his reliance on rare reagents like **Eldritch Lilies** to produce Aqua Delirium​.
    
- A side quest from **River of the Amethyst Academy** tasked the party with retrieving Oscar’s research—or even his brain—implying that Oscar was once a promising student expelled for dark practices​.
    
- Eventually, the party saw Oscar’s **severed head mounted** as a trophy by a different group (likely the **Black Iron** faction), strongly implying that they “resolved” the situation the party had left dangling​.
    
- The party had discussed sabotaging his deal with the Hooded Lanterns, but no strong follow-through occurred before another group acted.

## Faction Associations:

- **Formerly of the Amethyst Academy**: Expelled for alchemy/necromancy and unauthorized experimentation.
    
- **Supplier for the Hooded Lanterns**: Provided potions (some contaminated), with a protection-for-product arrangement in place​.
    
- **Indirect enemy of the Black Iron faction**: They seem to have taken action where others hesitated, displaying his head as a trophy.
    
- **Tenuous relations with your party**: He was willing to trade and interact, but also clearly didn’t trust you—nor did your group fully trust him.
