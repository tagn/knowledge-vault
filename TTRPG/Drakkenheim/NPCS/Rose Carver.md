## Summary:

**Rose Carver** was the original leader of the **Rose and Thorn** (also called “The Bouquet”), a sub-faction of the **Queen's Men** that operated out of Emberwood Village and controlled smuggling routes into Drakkenheim. A savvy, street-smart operator with a reputation for knowing her turf, Rose maintained the operation through a mix of intimidation, charm, and delegation. She became the party’s immediate superior within the Queen's Men—until she was **replaced**, leading to a brief internal shakeup. Eventually, the party took over the group themselves, **renaming it to “Keth’s Krew.”**

## Significant Events:

- The party was **recruited by Rose Carver** into the Rose and Thorn after Keth got involved with the Queen's Men, essentially becoming part of her crew through tribute and smuggling arrangements​.
    
- The party **retrieved a stolen package** from the Favored Few on her behalf, solidifying their standing with her and the Queen's Men​.
    
- She coordinated **smuggling operations through sewer tunnels** into the city and offered the party a cut of the profits in exchange for help clearing out threats blocking those routes​.
    
- She **sponsored the party's entrance into the arena**, helping them earn favor with the Queen of Blades. This included facilitating betting, payouts, and making introductions to notable fighters​.
    
- During the Buckledown Row tournament arc, she acted as your crew's **handler and financier**, rewarding your victories with heavy purses and keeping you aligned with Queen’s Men objectives​.
    
- Later, she was **quietly removed from her position**, replaced by someone the party found significantly less agreeable. This led to the group **staging a quiet takeover** of the operation and **rebranding** it as **Keth’s Krew**, effectively becoming their own faction under the Queen’s Men umbrella​.
