## Summary:

**Aldor the Immense** is a prominent merchant based in **Emberwood Village**, known primarily for dealing in magic items and particularly items associated with **Delirium**. He is described as physically imposing ("huge ass guy") and notably flamboyant, with an air of affluence, always surrounded by an aroma of fine tobacco and typically drinking wine. He travels with steel-skinned oxen breathing green mist and is guarded by armed attendants, which implies both wealth and caution given the dangerous nature of his trade.

## Significant Events:

- **Introduced** early in the campaign as a source of magical supplies, notably potions, spell scrolls, magical rings, gloves, and piles of material components.
    
- Operates a prominent magical goods shop near the **Caravan Park** in **Emberwood Village**, frequently visited by the party to stock up on important magical items and supplies.
    
- Provides useful insights into the handling and properties of **Delirium**, specifically cautioning against direct skin contact and prolonged exposure, emphasizing the risks and specialized handling required for this dangerous substance.
    
- Served as a key point of commerce when the party sought specific magical items, such as the **Dead Ringer's Mask** and healing potions.
    
- Offered rare and powerful magical items, albeit at steep prices, making him an influential figure for adventurers operating around Drakkenheim.

## Faction Associations:

- **Independent Merchant:** While **Aldor** does not appear to have explicit faction affiliations, his extensive involvement in trading **Delirium**-based items means he likely maintains careful, if unofficial, relationships with major factions such as:
    
    - **Amethyst Academy**: Likely collaborator or competitor, as both deal in magical artifacts and Delirium-based products.
        
    - **Queen's Men**: Indirect interactions likely due to their control over significant territory and criminal influence over trade in and around Emberwood Village.
        
    - **Hooded Lanterns**: Possibly viewed neutrally or positively due to his independent status and usefulness in providing supplies and magical items.
        

His positioning as a high-value merchant likely makes him a neutral party who skillfully navigates the complicated faction politics of Drakkenheim.
