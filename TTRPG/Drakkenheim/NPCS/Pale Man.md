## Summary:

The **Pale Man**, real name **Justin Tousant**, is a powerful former mage and Sihrr's **biological grandfather** or close relative. Once affiliated with the **Amethyst Academy**, he was cast out after it was discovered that he used his apprentices as test subjects for experiments involving **Delirium contamination**. He now resides in a secluded manor—dubbed **Grandfather’s Estate**—deep in the city, where he attempts to “restore dignity” to mutated Haze creatures. Despite his gentler treatment of dregs, his methods are still steeped in unethical experimentation. He is deeply obsessed with controlling and mastering contamination, claiming near-godlike power and pursuing access to the **Inscrutable Tower** to complete his work.

## Significant Events:

- **Reunion with Sihrr**: After nearly 20 years apart, Sihrr reunites with the Pale Man at his manor. The interaction is ambiguous—neither wholly hostile nor warm—but reveals their shared past and familial bond​.
    
- **Control over Haze Creatures**: He has stabilized and partially restored corrupted dregs, who now serve him in eerie docility. He refers to these creatures as those he has “sacrificed so much for,” suggesting both remorse and obsession​.
    
- **Confrontation with the Party**: While the party interacts diplomatically with him, there’s underlying tension. Keth and Silas suspect he may need to be “put down,” and he grows hostile when questioned about sensitive documents​.
    
- **Backstory Revealed**: The Pale Man aided the **Amethyst Academy** in the past but refused to share all his research. He now holds knowledge others covet, including the **Queen of Blades**, who has sent the party to obtain it​.
    
- **Delirium Manipulation**: He demonstrates powerful abilities such as turning Delirium to dust, conjuring deep Haze, and controlling it for potential cures. He suggests he can **remove contamination** and even restore minds twisted by the Haze—though he chooses not to, seeing utility in keeping some twisted followers​.
    
- **Vision of Royal Lineage**: Sihrr receives confirmation that he may be connected to the **royal bloodline**, with hints through magical vials linking him as a “Grandson” to _Ulrich the Fourth_​.

## Faction Associations:

- **Former Amethyst Academy Mage**: Expelled for using apprentices as test subjects. Now exists as a rogue arcane entity, obsessed with contamination and transformation.
    
- **No current faction allegiance**, but has friction with:
    
    - The **Amethyst Academy** (who want his knowledge and may still hunt him).
        
    - **River**, an Academy agent, who has sent people to steal from him—he expresses a strong desire to speak with her, claiming no harm but hinting at unfinished business​.
        
    - **Queen of Blades**, who wants his research, particularly for reversing monstrous transformation. She sends the party to extract information or recover documents​.
