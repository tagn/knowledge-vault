## Summary:

Lily is an artificial construct temporarily created and controlled by the character **Wyldenten Proudsky**. Specifically, Lily served as a scouting companion, likely constructed using artificer abilities. Lily provided reconnaissance and surveillance support to the party during their exploration and combat scenarios. Her existence was temporary and functional, serving primarily as a utility tool rather than an independently developed character.

## Significant Events:

- Lily scouted an old barn occupied by the group known as the **Favored Few**, providing the party with valuable intelligence regarding the inhabitants inside, including identifying a Tortle, a female dwarf, and an old goblin​.
    
- Lily also attempted to scout ahead at **Reed Manor** but was noted humorously to have performed poorly during this attempt, suggesting her functionality was situationally limited or dependent on rolls​.

- Indirectly associated with the party (**Keth's Krew**), specifically through her creator, **Wyldenten Proudsky**.
