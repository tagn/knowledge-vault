## Summary:

**Petra Lang** is a high-ranking officer (Lieutenant) in the **Hooded Lanterns**, a military faction descended from Drakkenheim’s former army. She is a strong, composed, and loyal leader, known for her bold features and command presence. Petra is the sister of **Ansom Lang**, another key figure within the Lanterns. She led a doomed expedition into **The Sprawl**, where she was badly injured during an encounter with ratlings. Later, she was **disfigured in a bombing** incident—an attack that **Wyldenten Proudsky** tried but failed to stop. Despite her injuries, Petra remains committed to the cause.

## Significant Events:

- **First introduced** as a confident, authoritative presence at the **Watchtower**, wearing the signature lantern brooch of the Lanterns. She briefs the party alongside Sergeant **Rain Highlash** on the dangers of entering the city, especially near the walls and gates​.
    
- Led a mission into **The Sprawl** that ended disastrously—ratlings overran her squad, and only two soldiers escaped. The party later **rescues her** during their own journey through the rat-infested tunnels and escorts her back to Emberwood Village, saving her life​.
    
- Petra’s injuries from the ratling attack are severe, but manageable at the time. She becomes a sympathetic figure due to her courage and resilience.
    
- **Disfigured in a bombing** at the Watchtower—a coordinated act of sabotage orchestrated (unknowingly) by the party via a package they delivered on behalf of the **Queen's Men**. Wyldenten Proudsky had suspected something was wrong and tried to prevent the explosion, but was **seconds too late**. The resulting blast caused severe injury and scarring to Petra​.
    
- Despite her trauma, she continues serving with the Hooded Lanterns, highlighting her strength and unwavering loyalty.
