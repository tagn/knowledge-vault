## Summary:

The **Knights of the Silver Order** are a holy militant order committed to the **eradication of Delirium**, the **purging of corruption**, and the **restoration of divine order** to Drakkenheim. While they profess noble ideals and bear an air of chivalry, their **zealotry and rigidity** make them dangerous allies and ruthless enemies. They serve the divine law as they interpret it—unflinching, absolute, and often unwilling to compromise. Their presence at the **Chapel of Saint Ardenna** marked a turning point in your campaign, where their demand for obedience forced the party into a direct confrontation with tragic consequences.

## Significant Events:

- First encountered during a **joint operation with the Church of the Falling Fire**, the Knights stood beside **Ophelia Reed** at the Chapel of Saint Ardenna. Their appearance, fully armored and mounted, established them as serious military power​.
    
- While initially aligned through the Church, the Knights made it clear that **compromise was not part of their doctrine**. Their goal was the **purification** of corrupted lands, people, and magic—regardless of cost.
    
- During the pivotal **Battle of the Chapel**, the Knights demanded the party choose a side in a power dispute involving **control over sacred territory and contaminated relics**. When the party **refused to submit to their authority**, hostilities erupted.
    
- In the ensuing battle, the Knights’ leader, **Sir Theodore Marshall**, personally slew **Arken**, a member of your party. This loss left a permanent scar on the group and ended any hope of reconciliation.
    
- The party **withdrew from the battlefield** and from any further dealings with the Knights, cementing them as a hostile faction from that point forward.

## Major Members:

- **Sir Theodore Marshall**: The commanding knight and leader of the Silver Order in Drakkenheim. A devout paladin or similar divine warrior, he wields enormous authority and holds to a strict code. Arken died by his hand—making him a personal enemy of the party.
    
- **Rank-and-file Silver Knights**: Elite, mounted, and disciplined. Often serve alongside the Church but operate under their own command structure. They enforce purification with steel and fire—no negotiation.

## Relationships:

- **Hostile to the Party**: After the Battle of the Chapel and the death of Arken, the Knights are beyond redemption as far as your group is concerned. They are treated as a **dangerous enemy**, to be avoided, outmaneuvered, or confronted if necessary.
    
- **Allied with the Church of the Falling Fire**, particularly the militant wing led by **Ophelia Reed**. They appear when the Church needs **muscle**—especially in areas where contamination or heresy must be "cleansed."
    
- **Opposed to the Amethyst Academy**: The Academy’s use of Delirium is anathema to the Silver Order’s mission. The Knights likely view them as a **blasphemous cabal**.
    
- **Would consider the Queen’s Men heretics or vermin**: Their criminality, use of corruption, and disdain for divine law place them firmly in the crosshairs of the Silver Order—though open battle between them is rare due to territory separation.
    
- **Ideological disdain for the Hooded Lanterns**: Despite both groups wanting to restore Drakkenheim, the Lanterns are “secular” and not sufficiently devoted to divine purification. The Knights would tolerate them—but never trust them.
