name: Hooded Lanterns

## Summary:

The **Hooded Lanterns** are a disciplined, militant faction descended from the remnants of **Drakkenheim’s city guard and royal military**. Operating out of fortified positions like the **Watchtower**, they believe themselves to be the legitimate stewards of the ruined city. Their mission is clear: **eradicate Delirium**, **restore order**, and reclaim Drakkenheim in the name of the old monarchy. Initially positioned as protectors and potential allies, their rigid command structure and **uncompromising moral authority** led to a major falling out with your party—culminating in the **execution of a party member**, which permanently fractured relations.

## Significant Events:

- The party was **welcomed by Rain Highlash and Petra Lang** early in the campaign at the Watchtower. They provided maps, tactical insight, and mission coordination, treating the group as potential allies or freelancers​.
    
- **Petra Lang** was **rescued by the party** after being severely injured by ratlings in the Sprawl, further strengthening early trust​.
    
- The relationship took a sharp turn when **one of your party members was executed** by the Lanterns. The exact rationale is not detailed in the logs, but it was likely related to perceived betrayal, corruption, or refusal to comply with Lantern orders or laws.
    
- Following this, the party’s trust **completely eroded**, and further interactions became strained, if not outright hostile.
    
- The **bombing at the Watchtower**, unintentionally enabled by the party (via a package delivered on behalf of the Queen’s Men), further escalated tensions. It **maimed Petra Lang** and led to **Wyldenten Proudsky’s execution**—even though he had tried to stop it​.
    
- The Lanterns continue their **anti-Delirium crusade**, often coming into conflict with other factions who use or trade in the substance.

## Major Members:

- **Elias Drexel**: Commander of the Hooded Lanterns. Rarely seen directly, but known to be the final authority in Lantern operations. Upholds a hardline stance against Delirium and corruption.
    
- **Petra Lang**: Lieutenant. Loyal, brave, and maimed during the Watchtower bombing. Previously saved by the party, later injured due to indirect party involvement. Continues to serve post-injury, likely with mixed feelings about the party​.
    
- **Rain Highlash**: Sergeant and one of the first Lanterns the party met. Professional and by-the-book. May still view the party with grudging respect, but answers to higher command​.
    
- **Ansom Lang**: Petra’s brother and another influential voice in the faction, more of a field leader and strategist.

## Relationships:

- **Fallen out with the Party**: Once allies, the execution of a party member and fallout from the bombing severed ties. Even if there’s lingering respect on the ground level, trust is gone. Reconciliation is unlikely unless the party dramatically shifts stance.
    
- **Opposed to the Queen’s Men**: Consider the Queen’s Men criminals and traitors. Lanterns have taken and executed Queen’s Men operatives, and the Queen of Blades orchestrates attacks and sabotage in response.
    
- **Ideological opposition to the Amethyst Academy**: The Academy seeks to use and study Delirium, while the Lanterns want it eradicated. This philosophical rift prevents full cooperation.
    
- **Friction with the Church of the Falling Fire**: The Church views Delirium as sacred; the Lanterns view it as a threat. Open conflict hasn’t broken out, but tensions simmer.
    
- **Unsteady diplomacy with the Ironhelm Dwarves**: The party helped broker some cooperation between the Lanterns and the Ironhelms, but the dwarves remain wary. The Lanterns are useful for protection, but their dogmatism is not appreciated.
