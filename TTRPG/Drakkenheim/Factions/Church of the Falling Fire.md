## Summary:

The **Church of the Falling Fire** is a dominant religious faction centered around the worship of the **“star that came”**—interpreted as divine judgment or revelation linked to the meteor that brought **Delirium** to Drakkenheim. This belief system blends traditional faith, eschatology, and purification through suffering or trial. The Church sees Delirium as both a sacred and dangerous force, demanding control and reverence, not eradication. Despite its apocalyptic overtones, the Church offers healing, community, and clarity of purpose in a city of madness. Your party has been **closely allied with them**, and they’ve provided significant support, especially in cleansing contamination and guiding spiritual conflicts.

## Significant Events:

- **Lucritia**, a spiritual leader in the Church, has offered sanctuary, healing, and ritual support to the party—especially in dealing with **Delirium contamination**​.
    
- Your group has frequently sought out guidance and cleansing through **Saint Selina’s Monastery** and the **Chapel of Saint Ardenna**, both key sites in the Church’s influence network.
    
- The Church was instrumental in **aiding Arken and Wyldenten** with corruption removal—making them one of the only groups capable of reliably helping with these afflictions.
    
- The party aligned with the Church in a **broader political sense**, often opposing factions like the Queen’s Men or the Amethyst Academy when their actions contradicted the Church’s moral outlook.
    
- While others questioned the Church’s **zealotry or apocalyptic tone**, your group has found their **devotion, structure, and clarity** to be valuable amid the chaos of Drakkenheim.

## Major Members:

- **Lucritia**: Spiritual leader and possibly the **High Flamekeeper** or equivalent within the Church. She plays a pivotal role in guiding the faith’s moral compass and interacting with outsiders. Respected, trusted, and seen by your party as a rare stable force.
    
- **Ophelia Reed**: **High Flamekeeper** of the **Chapel of Saint Ardenna**, flanked by **Knights of the Silver Order**. Wields potent divine magic and relics. While more militant and dogmatic than Lucritia, she represents the Church’s formal power and authority​.
    
- **Flamekeeper Hannah**: A junior flamekeeper who was previously infected with Delirium. Her healing and recovery likely came through Church intervention, showing their efficacy in spiritual-arcane matters​.

## Relationships:

- **Strong ally of the Party**: The Church has consistently aided your group with healing, cleansing, and sanctuary. They are perhaps the **closest ideological and practical ally** you’ve had throughout the campaign.
    
- **Tense with the Amethyst Academy**: The Church views the Academy’s unrepentant use of Delirium and arcane experimentation as dangerous and possibly heretical. Open conflict is rare, but distrust is deep.
    
- **Opposed to the Queen’s Men**: The Church likely sees the Queen of Blades as a blasphemous usurper, promoting corruption, criminality, and unholy power. They would dismantle the Queen’s influence if given the opportunity.
    
- **Friction with the Ironhelm Dwarves**: The Ironhelms reportedly **killed pilgrims** who approached their forge, and this has soured relations badly. The Church sees them as reckless profiteers at best, heretics at worst​.
    
- **Uneasy with the Hooded Lanterns**: Although not overtly hostile, the Lanterns’ militaristic and Delirium-burning approach doesn’t align with the Church’s more spiritual interpretation of the material’s role.
