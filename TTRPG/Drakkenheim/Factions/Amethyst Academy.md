## Summary:

The **Amethyst Academy** is a powerful and secretive arcane institution with deep historical roots in Drakkenheim. It is composed of mages, scholars, and arcane researchers committed—at least nominally—to the responsible use of magic and the containment or study of **Delirium**. However, their methods are often ethically questionable, and their political ambitions and desire to control arcane knowledge put them at odds with many factions. They are **notorious** for their harsh treatment of mages outside their control, including **abduction**, **experimentation**, and **execution**. This has earned them the distrust and resentment of many magic-users—**including your party**.

## Significant Events:

- The party’s **initial handler was River**, who issued assignments related to recovering magical research and tracking rogue elements (like Oscar Yorn). Her tone and expectations were clinical, if not cold, which immediately set a poor tone for relations​.
    
- The Academy tasked you with **retrieving documents or the brain of Oscar Yorn**, who was once one of their own but was expelled. This reveals a pattern: they often abandon rogue mages until they become useful or dangerous, then reassert control violently​.
    
- The party was asked to engage with the **Pale Man**, another former Academy member, now viewed as a rogue asset. The Academy wants his secrets—but didn’t share crucial context or risks, further deteriorating trust​.
    
- Academy agents are repeatedly shown to be **willing to lie, manipulate, or withhold information** to push operatives toward objectives. Their directives prioritize results over safety or transparency.
    
- The party ultimately **grew frustrated and disengaged**, operating more independently and keeping the Academy at arm’s length—though there’s still begrudging recognition of their power and resources.

## Major Members:

- **River**: Your original Academy contact. Professional, but not especially personable. She’s a handler-type who gives assignments and expects compliance. Her knowledge seems intentionally limited—either by design or internal hierarchy​.
    
- **The Pale Man (Justin Tousant)**: Former Academy mage, now rogue. While not formally a member anymore, his history with the Academy—and their pursuit of his knowledge—makes him a critical figure in their past failures.
    
- **Oscar Yorn**: Another expelled mage. His fall from grace shows the Academy’s lack of long-term support or rehabilitation for those who break their code.
    

_Note: Other senior mages or archmages haven’t shown up in the logs directly, but they are implied to exist, pulling strings above River’s level._

## Relationships:

- **Strained with the Party**: The Academy's history of treating magical individuals like assets or threats has **earned your party’s suspicion and resistance**. Despite working with them on occasion, your group has kept them at a distance and has no illusions about their motives.
    
- **Hostile toward the Pale Man and Oscar Yorn**: They see rogue mages as threats to be neutralized or exploited. Their pursuit of the Pale Man’s research is more about **control** than **redemption**.
    
- **Cautiously neutral with Queen’s Men**: There's little open conflict, but both factions would likely betray the other if arcane power or territory was at stake.
    
- **Tense coexistence with the Hooded Lanterns**: The Lanterns may distrust the Academy’s free use of Delirium. There’s no open war, but ideological opposition brews.
    
- **Opposed by the Church of the Falling Fire**: The Academy’s use of Delirium and arcane experimentation makes them **blasphemous** in the eyes of the church.
