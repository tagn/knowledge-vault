## Summary:

The **Queen’s Men** are a sprawling criminal syndicate operating in and around **Drakkenheim**, led by the enigmatic and cunning **Queen of Blades** (aka the **Queen of Thieves**). While composed largely of **smugglers**, **cutthroats**, and **mercenaries**, the faction operates with an unexpected level of structure, loyalty, and strategic vision. Though criminal by definition, the Queen’s Men have become **one of your party’s most stable and pragmatic allies**—willing to work through negotiation and mutual gain rather than dogma or idealism. Your own gang, **Keth’s Krew**, was born out of this partnership, giving you tangible power within the faction’s hierarchy.

## Significant Events:

- The party’s involvement with the Queen’s Men began through **Keth’s debt** to **Milando**, which led to entanglements with various underworld figures and eventually to a connection with **Rose Carver**, then-leader of the **Rose & Thorn** gang—a Queen’s Men sub-faction​.
    
- You helped **recover stolen goods** from rival gangs, earning the trust of the Queen’s Men and establishing yourselves as reliable operatives​.
    
- The party **entered and succeeded in the arena**, earning the Queen of Blades’ attention and a shift in her tone from cautious observer to semi-patron. She forgave Keth’s debt in exchange for a favor: retrieving research from the Pale Man that could help restore corrupted individuals​.
    
- **Rose Carver** was later removed from her leadership role—quietly or forcibly—and replaced by an unsatisfactory new boss. Your group **took over the Rose & Thorn**, **renamed it Keth’s Krew**, and began operating semi-independently within the Queen’s Men network​.
    
- The Queen of Blades tasked your group with **breaking into the Hooded Lantern garrison** and later hinted at her **larger endgame**—possibly involving the crowning of a new monarch or herself via the ancient Seals of Drakkenheim​.
    
- Despite some shady dealings (including orchestrating the Watchtower bombing), the Queen’s Men have **respected your autonomy**, provided resources, and treated you as rising players.

## Major Members:

- **Queen of Blades / Queen of Thieves**: The elusive, illusion-wielding leader of the Queen’s Men. A master manipulator who leads with intelligence, charisma, and hidden steel. She values loyalty, initiative, and usefulness above bloodlines or dogma​.
    
- **Rose Carver**: Former leader of the Rose & Thorn. A competent gang boss who recruited your party but was later ousted—possibly due to faction politics or inefficiency​.
    
- **Rita**: A retired (allegedly) assassin who commands immense respect within the Queen’s Men. While not an official leader, she is clearly a force to be reckoned with​.
    
- **Blackjack Mel**, **Veronica Venom**, and **others**: Lieutenants and gang leaders under the Queen’s Men umbrella, each with their own turf and style. Many maintain thematic bars and gangs (e.g., **Howling Dogs**, **Pins & Clubs**, etc.).

## Relationships:

- **Strong allies of the Party**: Your group is not only allied with the Queen’s Men—you’re part of them. **Keth’s Krew** operates under their name, and your relationship with the Queen of Blades is one of mutual benefit and cautious trust.
    
- **Opposed to the Hooded Lanterns**: The Queen’s Men and the Lanterns are engaged in a **slow war**—raids, sabotage, and executions are regular. The Lanterns view them as criminals; the Queen’s Men see the Lanterns as self-righteous thugs.
    
- **Antagonistic toward the Church of the Falling Fire**: The Queen’s Men represent secular power, self-interest, and freedom—everything the Church sees as heretical. Their end goals are fundamentally incompatible.
    
- **Mutually suspicious of the Amethyst Academy**: The Academy plays a different game, one of knowledge and arcane supremacy. The Queen’s Men may trade with them or tolerate them, but they don’t trust them.
    
- **Occasional tensions with the Ironhelm Dwarves**: The Ironhelms were paying protection to the Queen’s Men for a while but started pushing back. This relationship may flare into open conflict—or cut off completely depending on faction deals.
