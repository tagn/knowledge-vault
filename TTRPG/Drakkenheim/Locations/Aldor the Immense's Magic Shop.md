## Description

**Aldor the Immense’s Magic Shop** was one of **Emberwood Village’s premier sources for magical items**, specializing in **arcane curios, enchanted gear**, and **Delirium-related reagents**. It was run by **Aldor**, a flamboyant and mysterious merchant of _immense_ physical proportions — both in body and presence.

Nestled near the village’s commercial lane (possibly adjacent to **Caravan Park**), Aldor’s shop stood out not just for its wares, but for the sheer **otherworldliness of its proprietor**, who always seemed just a bit too grand for the world he occupied.

And then he was gone.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Tiny Chair**:
    
    - Aldor — despite being **unthinkably large** — perched effortlessly on a **comically tiny wooden chair** that somehow supported his vast weight.
        
    - After his **disappearance**, your party took the chair — which may or may not still possess **magical reinforcement or illusory properties**.
        
    - The chair stands as a strange memento of a being who likely **didn’t belong to this plane** in the first place.
        
- **Extravagant Decor**:
    
    - The shop was decorated with **smoking incense**, **velvet-lined display cases**, and rare materials.
        
    - His massive form was usually flanked by **steel-skinned oxen**, suggesting either **summoned guardians** or **illusory glamours**.
        
- **Wares and Inventory**:
    
    - Aldor’s inventory was **top-tier for the region**, including **scrolls, enchanted weapons, potions**, and other exotic magical items.
        
    - Prices were high, but so was the quality — and he often spoke in riddles, as though he **knew more than he let on**.
        
- **Djinn Identity**:
    
    - It was later discovered that **Aldor was a Djinn** — a **genie**, likely of **elemental or extraplanar origin**, who had **taken on a humanoid guise** to interact with mortals.
        
    - His presence in Emberwood was **never fully explained**, and his disappearance occurred **without warning or trace**, leaving behind only the tiny chair and confusion.
        

## Location Events

- **Repeated Visits by the Party**:
    
    - You frequented Aldor’s shop for **equipment upgrades**, **component purchases**, and **occasional conversation**, slowly building rapport — or at least intrigue.
        
    - He may have provided limited insight into Delirium or magical anomalies, always with an air of **calculated vagueness**.
        
- **Disappearance**:
    
    - One day, **Aldor was simply gone** — the shop empty, the wares vanished, the oxen missing.
        
    - No signs of violence, no farewell, no magical residue. Just absence — and the **chair**, absurd and unchanged.
        
- **Speculation**:
    
    - Whether Aldor was **spying**, **studying**, or simply **playing a long cosmic joke** is unclear.
        
    - His presence may have been tied to a **contract, a prophecy, or amusement** — but either way, he’s left Emberwood, and perhaps your party, **with more questions than answers**.
