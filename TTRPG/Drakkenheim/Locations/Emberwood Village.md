## Description

**Emberwood Village** is a **makeshift frontier settlement** located **just outside the city of Drakkenheim**, functioning as the primary **launch point for scavengers, mercenaries, and adventurers** seeking to brave the ruins. Originally a small, possibly half-abandoned village, Emberwood was **rebuilt and reinforced** after the meteor strike, taking on the character of a **refugee shantytown meets adventurer outpost**.

It was your party’s **initial home base**, where you were first paid, equipped, and introduced to the major factions and dangers surrounding Drakkenheim. Over time, however, your **relationship with the Hooded Lanterns — Emberwood’s de facto rulers — deteriorated**, and the village is now **hostile ground** for your group.

Despite the tension, Emberwood remains a **key logistical hub**, with vital services like **Caravan Park**, **Crow and Sons Smithy**, the **Chapel of Saint Ardenna**, and the **newly opened magic shop**. You continue to **infiltrate it via disguise, invisibility, or other stealth tactics** to access its resources.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

### Your Former Home

- You were granted **a house in Emberwood**, renovated for you by **Emma** (daughter of Tobias at the Smithy) and her family.
    
- It served as your **resting point, stash house, and staging ground** early on.
    
- After tensions with the **Hooded Lanterns** escalated, you were forced to **abandon the property**. It is now **occupied** by other villagers and **Lantern personnel**, and returning is **high-risk**.
    

### Caravan Park

- The **mercantile hub** of the village. Stalls, wagons, and peddlers gather here around a **boarded-up well**.
    
- Your go-to spot for supplies, gossip, and rumor-hunting.
    
- Home to **Armin Gainsbury**, an eccentric merchant, and the place where **Azan the Wanderer** briefly appeared.
    

### Chapel of Saint Ardenna

- A **circular temple** devoted to the **Church of the Falling Fire**, staffed by **Flamekeeper Hannah** and visited by **Ophelia Reed**.
    
- The brazier at its center is used for **purging or inducing mutation**, and it serves as the **religious touchstone** for many villagers.
    

### Crow and Sons Smithy

- The **local blacksmith**, run by **Tobias and his son Peter**.
    
- Functional, a bit shabby, but critical for repairing and upgrading gear.
    
- Close family ties to Emma, who has appeared frequently in your early village scenes.
    

### The Bark & Buzzard

- The **go-to adventurer tavern** — gritty, map-covered tables, known for drawing real operators.
    
- You met **Karen** (the bartender), and were introduced to the **Gentlemen Bastards** here.
    

### Vil's Magic Shop

- **Recently opened** within the village, but **frequently visited** by your party.
    
- Offers magical goods, scrolls, and minor enchanted items.

## Location Events

- **Arrival & Early Quests**: You were paid your first job wages here and began establishing connections with key figures like **Eren Marlow**, **Armin**, and **Emma**.
    
- **Faction Introductions**: Your first real exposure to the **Hooded Lanterns** and **Church of the Falling Fire** took place in Emberwood. You were also warned about the **Queen’s Men** from here.
    
- **Party Home**: Your house served as a **safe haven** for the early game — a quiet place to sleep, rest, and plan.
    
- **Tensions with Hooded Lanterns**: Your group’s **increasing autonomy and questionable allegiances** drew suspicion from the Lanterns. After a string of events (including **carrying out missions for rival factions**), you were **effectively exiled**.
    
- **Ongoing Infiltration**: You still visit for supplies or contact, but only through **disguises, invisibility, or careful timing**. Getting caught would likely spark immediate confrontation.
