## Description

Small village about five miles south of [[Drakkenheim]]. This is where our adventurers return after travels. There are various establishments and services available in the area, but since the area on 
the outskirts of a literal hellscape, services in the town are very costly.

Most of the people here are trying to make ends meet, with some adventurers passing through to make treks to the outskirts of the ruined city and some more ambitious will venture inside of the walls to search for [[Delerium]] and other treasures.

### Bark & Buzzard
Tavern run by a nice lady named Karen. They offer "rooms" to stay, which are actually run down houses near the tavern. Our group paid for a few rooms.

#### Notes
- Our group participated in the talent show here one evening when we arrived in town and made a small amount of gold by putting on a daredevil spectacle.

Tavern that is quite roudy compared to the rest. Very cheap to drink. Seems to be "run" by members of the [[Queen's Men]].
