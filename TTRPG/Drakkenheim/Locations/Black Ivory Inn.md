## Description

The **Black Ivory Inn** is a **three-story, pristine-looking inn built from black wood**, located on the **north side of the Drann River** within the city of **Drakkenheim**. It's in **shockingly good condition** compared to the surrounding ruin — untouched by decay or damage, as if frozen in time 20 years prior.

Inside, the inn was **dimly candle-lit** and filled with well-dressed, eerily calm patrons. Despite the apparent normalcy, the place was caught in a **temporal loop**, replaying the day of the meteor strike over and over. Time inside the inn **moved differently**, and residents frequently **forgot who they were or how they arrived**. Magical auras and detection revealed **no immediate threats**, but the strangeness only deepened as your party investigated.

After uncovering the loop’s mechanics and confronting the magical threats, your group managed to **break the enchantment**, freeing several trapped individuals and reclaiming access to the tunnel system beneath the inn.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Ms. Charlotte**: A woman playing piano ceaselessly, clearly enchanted or compelled. Her performance was a key element of the loop’s continuity.
    
- **Room 106**: The room your group rested in — potentially the first deviation from the inn’s ritualistic timeline.
    
- **Room 101**: Contained magical items, including a **heating stone** that was identified and stolen by Wyldenten Proudsky.
    
- **Knight in Armor**: A mysterious protector of Ms. Charlotte who attacked Arken during one of your breakout attempts.
    
- **The Smuggler’s Den**: A secret lower level beneath the inn accessed via the **cellar**, containing:
    
    - **Captain Wickett**, leader of a smuggling operation.
        
    - Various other smugglers, mercs, and lowlifes using the space for black market dealings and poker games.
        
- **Magical Loop**: Time would reset after the **meteor strike event**, which occurred each “evening.” Most people in the inn were unaware or only partially conscious of the repetition.
    
- **The Flesh Abomination**: A grotesque creature guarding part of the lower level; fought and defeated during your escape.
    
- **Exit Tunnel**: One known tunnel leads to **Slaughter Stone Square (Executioner's Square)**, a highly dangerous area in Drakkenheim occupied by an entity known as _the Executioner_.
    

## Location Events

- **Initial Entry**: Your party arrived after crossing the river, found the inn inexplicably intact and operating, despite the ruin around it.
    
- You interacted with enchanted staff and guests, some of whom began regaining awareness as time wore on. You discovered that **time moved faster inside** than outside — e.g., 5:40 PM was “two hours from now,” while outside it was 9:30 AM.
    
- Wyldenten had a full-blown panic spiral upon realizing the temporal shenanigans, believing he was reliving the day of the meteor.
    
- Keth Darklighter and others explored rooms, pilfered magic items, and tested the boundaries of the illusion.
    
- Eventually, a confrontation with a **fireball-throwing wizard**, summoned **fire elemental**, and chaotic combat triggered a major break in the loop.
    
- Below the inn, you negotiated and then fought with **Captain Wickett**’s crew. **Fifer** (a repeating inn resident) was murdered by Keth, a mage was blamed, and combat erupted.
    
- During the conflict, a **massive flesh horror** consumed Wyldenten Proudsky, who plane-shifted to escape and then dramatically killed it from the inside.
    
- The temporal anomaly ended, and survivors like **Aaron Grint (Hooded Lanterns)**, **Anika Patel (Silver Order)**, and **Balthazar Adamos (Falling Fire priest)** were freed.
    
- Some of these NPCs have since played continued roles in your journey — including granting you **water-walking across the river** and providing information about **Camp Dawn**, **Saint Selina’s Monastery**, and the **Knights of the Silver Order**.
