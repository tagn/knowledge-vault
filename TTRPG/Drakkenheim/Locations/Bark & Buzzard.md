## Description

The _Bark & Buzzard_ is a tavern in Emberwood Village. It has a more rugged, no-nonsense feel compared to some of the other establishments in the village. It's mentioned multiple times as a go-to spot for actual adventurers — less frilly than the _Gilded Lily_, less dangerous than _Skull & Sword_, and not as snooty as the _Red Lion Hotel_.

It serves drinks and food, though the food quality has been described as “shitty,” and it’s the kind of place with **rolled-up laminated maps on the tables**, which suggests it caters to mercs and explorers.

You were specifically told to ask for **Karen** and to tell her that **Eren sent you** — seems like a password or passphrase that identifies you as allies or trusted contacts.

Also notable: this was supposedly **Sammy Eight-Fingers’** favorite hangout before the **Lord of the Feast** “pinned him down somewhere in town.” That hints at some heavy history and the kind of clientele the place draws in.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Karen**: The bartender or proprietor; seems to be in the know and tied into the local network of adventurers.
    
- **Laminated Maps on Tables**: Practical. This isn’t just a watering hole—it’s a staging ground for expeditions.
    
- **Used to be a haunt of Sammy Eight-Fingers**, a now-deceased (or at least, “pinned”) character of local infamy.
    
- Frequented by groups like the **Gentlemen Bastards**.
    
- It’s where **Grummish**, the bugbear adventurer, can often be found — one of the _Gentlemen Bastards_. You asked him for information there once.

## Location Events

- **Initial Visit**: You were sent there on arrival in Emberwood and greeted by Karen. You ordered drinks and were approached by **Renard**, who seems to run a band called the _Gentlemen Bastards_, along with **Lyrian** (an elven woman) and **Grummish** (a bugbear with massive glasses).
    
- **Grummish gave you intel** on the general area of _The Sprawl_ south of _Shepard’s Way_ when asked. He also requested some wine if you happen to find any.
    
- **Ansom Lang**, a captain aligned with the _Hooded Lanterns_, met you at the Bark & Buzzard at one point to give a briefing and offer gold for a mission. It seems like it doubles as a sort of informal headquarters or neutral meeting ground.
    
- **Later visits** involved reconvening to discuss what to do with your Delerium haul and resting after missions.
