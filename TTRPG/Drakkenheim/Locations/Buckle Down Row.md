## Description

**Buckle Down Row** is the **primary stronghold of the Queen’s Men** within the **Haze-covered interior of Drakkenheim**. Unlike most of the ruined city, this district is in **surprisingly decent condition** — **repaired buildings**, **guarded streets**, and **established infrastructure**, albeit all controlled by criminal factions.

The area is **well-lit, heavily guarded**, and **organized**, showing a level of structure not often seen elsewhere in the Haze. While technically part of the corrupted, monster-infested city, Buckle Down thrives — not because it's free of danger, but because **danger is part of the economy**. It's built by and for thugs, bandits, mercs, and fixers. Think of it as a neutral zone for the unsavory.

Despite being within the Haze, it somehow manages to function as a hub — perhaps through unknown magical protections or sheer force of will by those who run it. The **Queen of Blades** rules here by proxy, collecting tribute from every gang and tavern, with **loyalty enforced** through reputation, debt, and implied violence.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

### Surface Level Establishments

- **Sweaty Bugbear**:  
    A grimy bar fronted by a literal **sweaty bugbear cook**. Known for its **knife-throwing games** — including at a **gnome strapped to a target**. It’s the hangout for the **Howling Dogs**, run by **Baskerville**, a massive, red-bearded dwarf with a cruel streak.
    
    - The Howling Dogs wear a brooch of **two howling dogs at the moon**.
        
    - **Rita**, a retired but **lethal assassin**, lingers in the back.
        
- **The Lock Bar**:  
    Decorated **wall to ceiling in padlocks**. Has a strange atmosphere and an eccentric clientele. Run by **Leon, the Swine Prince** — purple mohawk, furs, drinks strange brews.
    
    - To join his gang, the **Pins and Clubs**, you must **kill someone from another gang and deliver their hand**.
        
- **The Rose and Thorns** (aka _The Bouquet_):  
    A more "reasonable" gang operation run by **Rose Carver**, an elegant but dangerous figure. Keth Darklighter ended up joining this group, paying **5% of take** and receiving support, leads, and turf privileges.
    
- **Mystery Tavern with Keys on the Door**:  
    Mentioned briefly — may be symbolic or connected to one of the gangs like the Pins and Clubs.

- To **earn favor or rise within the Queen’s ranks**, groups must **fight the current champion**.
