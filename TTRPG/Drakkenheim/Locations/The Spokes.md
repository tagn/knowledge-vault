## Description

**The Spokes** is a district in the **outer city of Drakkenheim**, named for its position as a **convergence point of several major roads** leading into the heart of the city — like the **hub of a wheel**. Before the fall, it was likely a **bustling commercial zone**, filled with **shops, artisan workshops**, and small-scale magical retailers. After the meteor, it became **a fractured, dangerous ruin**, riddled with **structural collapse**, **arcane instability**, and **Delirium contamination**.

Now, The Spokes sits in a strange liminal state: **partially reclaimed**, **partially cursed**, and under the eye of several interested parties — including the **Ironhelm dwarves**, who have begun **resettling and fortifying parts of it**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Wyldenton's Family Shop**:
    
    - This district was the **home of Wyldenton Proudsky**, whose **parents ran a small magic shop** here before their deaths in the meteor strike.
        
    - The store was likely modest but **well-loved**, focused on enchanted curios, scrolls, and minor magical supplies.
        
    - The ruins of the shop may still hold **personal belongings, family artifacts**, or **fragments of unfinished magical work** — all heavily tied to Wyldenton’s backstory and sense of self.
        
- **Collapsed Commercial Infrastructure**:
    
    - Much of The Spokes is made up of **ruined buildings**, some still bearing **signs of old shops, signage, and merchant stalls**.
        
    - The streets are **uneven**, full of **cracked stone, craters**, and **pockets of lingering magical energy**.
        
- **Ironhelm Presence**:
    
    - The **Ironhelm dwarves** have begun reclaiming part of The Spokes, likely establishing a **forward smithy** or **base of operations** here.
        
    - They see the area as a **valuable Delirium-rich frontier**, easier to work than the more volatile zones deeper in the city.
        
- **Dangerous but Navigable**:
    
    - Compared to deeper city zones, The Spokes is **semi-accessible** — risky, but not suicidal.
        
    - It remains under threat from **Haze-creatures**, **magical anomalies**, and potentially **delirium-induced spatial warping**.
        

## Location Events

- **Wyldenton’s Personal Journey**:
    
    - Wyldenton returned here during your journey, facing the **emotional wreckage of his family’s home** and the unresolved trauma of the meteor’s aftermath.
        
    - Exploring the ruins allowed for **personal closure, magical discovery**, or at the very least, deeper context into who he was and what he lost.
        
- **Factional Interest**:
    
    - The area has drawn the eye of the **Amethyst Academy** and possibly the **Hooded Lanterns**, though neither has established formal control.
        
    - Any expansion of Ironhelm control here could provoke **political friction**, especially if Delirium veins are confirmed beneath the rubble.
