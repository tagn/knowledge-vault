## Description

The **Kleinburg Estate** is a **manor house and estate grounds located within the ruins of Drakkenheim**, previously hidden or simply avoided due to its **deep entanglement with Delirium magic, planar distortion, and personal mystery**. For years following the meteor’s impact, it served as the **residence of the Pale Man** — a **powerful and unsettling arcane figure** whose identity and intentions remain murky.

The estate is **grand but decayed**, existing in that uncanny space between **stately opulence** and **post-apocalyptic ruin**. Within its grounds, **time, identity, and memory** feel slippery — fitting, given the emotional and magical weight it carries.

For **Sihrr**, the estate is ground zero for one of the campaign’s most personal threads: a **reunion with someone claiming to be his grandfather**, and the unraveling of whatever truth lies beneath that claim.

## Notable Landmarks or Features
