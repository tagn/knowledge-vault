## Description

The **Clocktower** is a **towering, ancient structure** located near the **center of Drakkenheim**, long regarded as non-functional, inert, and irrelevant — just another casualty of the meteor strike. For years, the Clocktower sat **silent**, its great hands unmoving, its inner workings choked with dust, debris, and forgotten power.

Recently, however, your party **reactivated the Clocktower** using **inert Delirium recovered from the Inscrutable Tower**, triggering a **massive planar and magical shift** in the surrounding area. Now, the Clocktower is not only **alive and humming with temporal energy**, but it has become your party’s **primary residence and potential failsafe** — a foothold of stability in a city unraveling at the seams.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Clock Mechanism**:
    
    - Once jammed and dormant, the great mechanism is now fully functional, **ticking with precise rhythm** and radiating magical energy.
        
    - Its activation caused **observable shifts in the surrounding district**, suggesting it is **anchored to temporal or planar stability** in some capacity.
        
- **Reality Restoration Field**:
    
    - Upon activation, the area around the Clocktower — including **Market Square Plaza** — was **visibly restored to its pre-fall state**: cobbled streets mended, buildings pristine, ambient noise of a city alive.
        
    - But it quickly became clear this is likely an **illusion or partial overlay**, not a true physical restoration. The effect is either **projected by the Clocktower**, or reflects **a stored memory of the city**.
        
- **Temporal Contingency Magic**:
    
    - The Clocktower now houses a **stored state** of the party — a magical snapshot or backup that can **restore you in the event of catastrophe**.
        
    - This is an extremely powerful and rare form of **temporal contingency**, suggesting the tower itself is **tied to time magic**, possibly even acting as a **time-anchoring device** for Drakkenheim itself.
        
- **Party Base of Operations**:
    
    - Your group has claimed the tower as a **residence and headquarters**, leveraging its magical stability and central location for **planning, defense, and storage**.
        
    - It is one of the few places in the city where you can **rest, research, and prepare** without constant threat of contamination or interruption.
        

## Location Events

- **Reactivation of the Clocktower**:
    
    - Using **inert Delirium** brought from the **Inscrutable Tower**, your party successfully reactivated the Clocktower’s internal systems.
        
    - This caused the surrounding area to **visibly transform**, and triggered changes across **both space and time** in localized ways.
        
- **Magical Safeguards and Temporal Mechanics**:
    
    - The “party snapshot” functionality hints that the Clocktower was **designed or repurposed as a chronomantic structure**, possibly to **preserve individuals or knowledge** through apocalyptic events.
        
    - Whether this was **intentional pre-fall design**, or a later adaptation by an unknown force, remains unclear.
        
- **Implications for the City**:
    
    - The Clocktower may be one of the **few remaining arcane artifacts capable of affecting Drakkenheim’s fundamental corruption**.
        
    - Factions are likely becoming aware of its reactivation — and depending on their goals, this will either **attract alliances or paint a target on your backs**.
