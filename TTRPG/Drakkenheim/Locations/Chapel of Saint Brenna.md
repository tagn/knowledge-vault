## Description

The **Chapel of Saint Brenna** is a **forgotten, ruined place of worship** buried somewhere in the crumbling interior of Drakkenheim. While not as politically central as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio or as corrupted as the Chapel of Saint Ardenna, this chapel still carries **deep pre-fall religious roots** — likely tied to the **Sacred Flame** — and hides **secrets beneath its crumbling sanctum**.

Your party explored it primarily for what lay **beneath it**: a dungeon-like structure filled with **arcane traps, magical constructs**, and signs that this site was far more than a place of worship. It may have been a **testing ground**, a **sealed vault**, or something much older and more obscure.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Crumbling Upper Chapel**:
    
    - The surface structure is largely destroyed — likely collapsed in the meteor’s aftermath or overtaken by time and the Haze.
        
    - What remains may be little more than **stained stone walls**, **toppled pews**, and half-buried iconography of **Saint Brenna**, whose lore is still largely unknown.
        
- **Subterranean Vault**:
    
    - Beneath the chapel lies a **sealed dungeon**, filled with **elemental creatures** (such as **mephits**), **arcane puzzles**, and signs of magical containment.
        
    - One chamber featured an **immovable rod-like mechanism** connected to a **magical testing room**, possibly used by ancient clerics or mages as a **training or purification site**.
        
- **Residual Arcane Energy**:
    
    - Despite being a religious site, the basement was laced with **magical traps and containment fields**, suggesting either **collaboration with arcane forces** or **post-fall contamination** that has twisted its original purpose.
        

## Location Events

- **Party Exploration and Puzzle Solving**:
    
    - Your group delved into the chapel’s crypts, solved the **rod-based puzzle**, and likely **disarmed or bypassed magical defenses** to reach deeper chambers.
        
    - This excursion yielded **minor relics**, **arcane insights**, and perhaps most importantly, **experience navigating mixed arcane-divine dungeons**.
        
- **Elemental Encounters**:
    
    - The presence of **mephits** — small elemental trickster-creatures — suggests either **elemental summoning gone wrong**, or **residual planar bleed** from deeper within the city.
        
    - These weren’t just random monsters — their presence may point to **experimental rituals** or long-abandoned **defensive wards**.
        
- **Unknown Purpose**:
    
    - The true intent of the vault is still unclear — it may have been a **holy proving ground**, a **buried relic chamber**, or an **unofficial containment site**.
        
    - There may be more to discover, particularly if Saint Brenna’s lore connects to other figures like **Saint Ardenna**, **Saint Selina**, or the broader **Sacred Flame pantheon**.
