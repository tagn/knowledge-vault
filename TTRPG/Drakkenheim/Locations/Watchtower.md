## Description

The **Watchtower** is the **primary base of operations for the Hooded Lanterns** in **Emberwood Village**, built atop or repurposed from an old **fortified tower structure**. It’s a **military command post, barracks, and intelligence hub** — a visible symbol of order, strength, and control at the edge of chaos.

It serves as the Lanterns’ **staging ground for operations into Drakkenheim**, and once functioned as a **diplomatic center** where factions and adventurers could receive jobs, turn in information, and negotiate alliances. Now, for your party, it’s **enemy territory** — a place you once walked freely, now likely approached only in disguise or not at all.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Tower Itself**:
    
    - Sturdy, reinforced, and built with **stone and ironwood**, the Watchtower **oversees the village’s perimeter** and **monitors traffic into the ruins**.
        
    - Equipped with **ranged defenses**, including **ballistae or repeating crossbows**, and manned at all hours.
        
- **Strategic Command Hub**:
    
    - Within the tower are **maps, intelligence briefings**, and likely **battle plans** for incursions into the city.
        
    - Acts as a **nerve center** for communication with Lantern scouts and embedded agents within Drakkenheim.
        
- **Housing and Armory**:
    
    - Many **Lantern soldiers live on-site**, and the tower also serves as **weapons storage** and a location to issue or reclaim magical gear.
        
    - Prison cells or holding rooms may exist in the lower levels, used for interrogations or temporary detentions.
        
- **Restricted Access**:
    
    - While it once had a **public-facing role**, especially for adventurers like yourselves, it’s now likely **on high alert**, particularly when your party is rumored to be nearby.
        
    - Approach without clearance or cover is **near-suicidal** at this point in the campaign.
        

## Location Events

- **Initial Party Contact**:
    
    - Early in your journey, you worked with the **Hooded Lanterns**, receiving jobs and briefings here.
        
    - You built a working relationship with figures like **Ansom Lang**, and the Watchtower was a place of **coordination, respect, and trust** — at first.
        
- **Tensions and Betrayal**:
    
    - Over time, as your party’s **alliances with other factions deepened** — especially with **the Amethyst Academy** and later the **Queen’s Men** — the relationship with the Lanterns grew **strained, then hostile**.
        
    - Your actions at **Shepard’s Gate**, as well as your handling of Delirium and political loyalties, ultimately led to a **full breakdown in relations**.
        
- **Wyldenton’s Execution (Aftermath)**:
    
    - While the execution occurred at **Shepard’s Gate**, the **decision, planning, and staging** almost certainly ran through the Watchtower.
        
    - This location became a symbol of the **irreconcilable split between your party and the Lanterns**.
        
- **Current Status**:
    
    - Fully controlled by the **Hooded Lanterns**, heavily fortified, and likely **hostile toward your group**.
        
    - You may have **infiltrated or skirted past it** in disguise, but any direct action against it would be **a major escalation**.
