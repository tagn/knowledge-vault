## Description

**Drakkenheim** refers both to the **city** at the core of the campaign and the **larger region** surrounding it, which includes outlying areas like **Emberwood Village**, **The Scar**, and **the Drann River basin**. Once a **thriving royal capital**, the city of Drakkenheim was **obliterated by a meteor strike**, which heralded the arrival of **the Haze** and the rise of **Delirium**, forever altering the land and shattering the realm's political, religious, and magical foundations.

The city is now **a cursed ruin**, its **walls warped**, **buildings crumbled**, and **air thick with arcane corruption**. At its center lies the impact crater — the **epicenter of Delirium** — where reality grows thin and monsters, madness, and miracles flourish in equal measure.

Drakkenheim is the **ultimate objective** for nearly every faction in the game, and the city’s fate will almost certainly determine the future of the realm. **Drakkenheim isn’t just a ruined city — it’s a crucible of ideology, ambition, and mutation.**  It’s not about who survives here. It’s about who **defines what survival even means**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

### The Haze

- A **magical, mutagenic fog** that blankets much of the city.
    
- Exposure to the Haze corrupts flesh, mind, and soul — long-term presence causes **mutation, hallucination**, and **contamination**.
    
- It reacts to Delirium, amplifies spells, and **messes with planar boundaries**.
    
- **Resting is impossible** within the Haze without magical protection or intervention.
    

### Castle Drakken

- The **former royal seat**, now cloaked in the deepest part of the Haze.
    
- Home to **flying figures** and surrounded by legend — including tales of a **resurrectable dragon buried deep beneath**.
    

### Slaughter Stone Square (Executioner's Square)

- An **infamous plaza** still patrolled by a supernatural entity known only as **The Executioner**.
    
- A **tunnel from beneath the Black Ivory Inn** exits into this square.
    
- Said to be the **deathtrap of dozens of adventurers**.
    

### The Spokes

- Once a **bustling commercial district**, now partially reclaimed by dwarves (**the Ironhelms**).
    
- Hosts contested sites, **Delirium veins**, and **mechanized mining operations**.
    
- The Ironhelms operate a smithy here — rivaling Emberwood’s.
    

### The Scar

- A **massive wound in the land** left by the meteor's passage, partially explored.
    
- Considered a **no-man’s land** full of Delirium, craters, unstable terrain, and abominations.
    

### Buckle Down Row

- **Criminal enclave** deep in the city, fortified and thriving despite the Haze.
    
- Headquarters of the **Queen’s Men**, home to **The Pits**, and heavily guarded.
    
- Controlled chaos: taverns, fighting pits, assassins, smugglers, and a weekly tribute to the Queen of Blades.
    

### The Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio

- Recently **reclaimed by the Church of the Falling Fire** after a brutal battle.
    
- Site of **Arken Highbloom’s death**, and a massive shift in religious power within the city.
    

### Shrine of the Old Gods

- Located **north of Castle Drakken**, home to **Old Zoya**, a druidic figure with power over **life and death**.
    
- Allegedly a place of **healing** — but also ancient, alien, and quietly terrifying.
    

### Other Key Locales

- **Saint Selina’s Monastery**: A sacred site for the Church of the Falling Fire. Possibly connected to rituals or deeper mysteries.
    
- **Black Ivory Inn**: Temporally unstable inn, previously trapped in a **time loop**, now broken. Served as a smugglers’ hub.
