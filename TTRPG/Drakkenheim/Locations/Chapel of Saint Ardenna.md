## Description

The **Chapel of Saint Ardenna** is a **circular temple located in Emberwood Village**, devoted to the worship of the “**Star That Came**” — the meteor that shattered Drakkenheim. It operates under the **Church of the Falling Fire**, a **heretical offshoot** of the original Sacred Flame, and serves as one of the first locations where your group encountered the **new religious order’s beliefs and rituals** firsthand.

Inside, the chapel houses a **large bronze brazier** at its center, perpetually burning with **roaring golden flame**, giving the entire chamber an eerie, reverent glow. The building’s **stained-glass windows** depict **meteoric impacts** raining down upon the city — a not-so-subtle sign that the faith here has drifted far from orthodoxy.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Flamekeeper Hannah**:  
    A charismatic and seemingly kind priestess of the Falling Fire who administers blessings and guidance at the chapel.
    
    - She has a **Delirium shard embedded in her chest**, pulsing with magical energy.
        
    - It was revealed that she may be **deeply contaminated**, possibly permanently altered by prolonged exposure to Delirium.
        
    - Hannah appears to be a **true believer**, possibly manipulated or genuinely chosen by the faith’s new “divine” influence.
        
- **Ophelia Reed**:  
    A **high-ranking figure** within the Church of the Falling Fire, also present at the chapel during your encounters.
    
    - Carries **several powerful magical items**, including a **censer**, **metal gloves**, and a **mysteriously glowing sack**.
        
    - Her presence reinforces that the chapel is more than a village outpost — it's a **strategic waypoint** for the Falling Fire’s influence in the region.
        
- **Mutagenic Consecration**:  
    Exposure to the brazier and interaction with the flame (or relics like Hannah’s shard) seem to result in **mutations**.
    
    - **Arken Highbloom** touched the Delirium shard in Hannah’s chest and was **mutated**, an early foreshadowing of the corruption lying beneath the Church’s holy veneer.
        
    - **Wyldenten Proudsky** was later **cleansed of corruption** here — proof the flame _can_ purify… but at what cost?
        

## Location Events

- Your group first visited early in the campaign and observed **rituals**, **songs**, and **sermons** that reframed the **meteor’s destruction as divine providence**.
    
- A **pamphlet** on the correct handling of Delirium was purchased here — includes diagrams, usage guidelines, and precautions, treating the dangerous substance as **sacred and utilitarian**.
    
- The chapel offered basic supplies for dealing with Delirium, including **mining picks**, **gloves**, and **goggles** — a sign of just how institutionalized Delirium harvesting has become in their faith.
    
- **Arken’s mutation**, as well as the later realization that **Flamekeeper Hannah was already hosting Delirium**, deepened the party’s distrust and dread surrounding the chapel.
    
- The group returned multiple times — to **question**, to **seek healing**, and to **gather information** on the broader Church of the Falling Fire. Each time, the sense of unease grew.
