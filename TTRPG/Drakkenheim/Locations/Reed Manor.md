## Description

**Reed Manor** is a **dilapidated estate** on the **outskirts of Drakkenheim**, situated within the **Drakkenheim Wilds** or just inside the outer city boundary, depending on how you slice the map. Once a proper noble’s home, the manor has been **corrupted and reconfigured** into the **private laboratory and sanctuary of Oscar Yorn**, an alchemist who crossed every ethical line in pursuit of **Delirium-based experimentation**.

The estate is surrounded by **overgrown grounds**, warped structures, and an air of decay — but it is unmistakably active. Strange lights, unnatural sounds, and the **presence of monstrous constructs** marked the manor even before you stepped inside.

Oscar Yorn is now **deceased**, but the legacy of his work and the horrors he created **linger in the stone, in the lab tables, and possibly in the things he left behind**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Oscar Yorn’s Laboratory**:
    
    - The heart of the manor was transformed into an alchemical workshop, complete with **glassware**, **ritual circles**, and **Delirium-infused contraptions**.
        
    - He was known for producing **Aqua Delirium**, a potent and dangerously unstable magical substance.
        
    - Evidence pointed to **necromantic experimentation**, including possible use of Delirium to **reanimate or mutate organic material**.
        
- **The Construct Servants**:
    
    - The manor was guarded and maintained by **large, bandaged brutes** — not quite flesh golems, not quite undead.
        
    - These beings may have been **created by Oscar**, or **inhabitants reshaped** by his experiments.
        
    - It is unclear whether any remain active following his death, though you’d be smart to assume at least one still shambles the halls.
        
- **Cursed Grounds**:
    
    - The land around the manor has a feel of **arcane instability** — not fully within the Haze, but certainly influenced by it.
        
    - Flora and fauna nearby were likely mutated, and lingering magical effects may still **contaminate or twist intruders**.
        

## Location Events

- **Party Confrontation with Oscar Yorn**:
    
    - Your party traveled to Reed Manor after Oscar **severed ties with the Hooded Lanterns and the Amethyst Academy**, choosing instead to **pursue his research independently**.
        
    - What followed was a confrontation that ended with **Oscar Yorn’s death**, but not before learning the depth of his obsession and the **moral abyss he had fallen into**.
        
- **Reveal of His True Work**:
    
    - The manor’s laboratory revealed that Oscar was not just studying Delirium — he was **weaponizing it**, crafting new forms of life, death, and magic.
        
    - It remains unknown who or what might be **interested in continuing his work** — or how much of it has already been smuggled out or replicated.
        
- **Aftermath**:
    
    - With Oscar gone, Reed Manor is now **abandoned but still dangerous** — possibly ripe for looting, repurposing, or reoccupation by less human forces.
        
    - The **Academy and Lanterns both had reason to want him dead or contained**, and may now be vying for **control of the research he left behind**.
