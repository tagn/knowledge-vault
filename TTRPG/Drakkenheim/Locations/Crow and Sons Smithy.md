## Description

**Crow and Sons Smithy** is the **primary blacksmith shop in Emberwood Village**, a functional and well-used establishment where weapons, armor, and basic metalwork are forged. It’s not fancy — the word that comes up is “**shitty**” — but it gets the job done, and it's probably the only game in town if you need a blade sharpened or armor patched before heading into the ruins.

The shop is **run by Tobias**, a **grizzled, large-bearded man with salt-and-pepper hair**, and assisted by his **teenaged son, Peter**. The smithy is built more for **utility than beauty**, but it's part of the backbone of the adventuring ecosystem within Emberwood.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Functional Design**:  
    Not elegant or ornate. The smithy prioritizes **durability and output**, supplying adventurers and townsfolk with the gear needed to survive the surrounding madness.
    
- **Family Run**:
    
    - **Tobias** is the owner, a classic no-nonsense smith who doesn’t sugarcoat the state of his shop or town.
        
    - **Peter**, his son, helps with daily tasks and likely represents the next generation of tradespeople trying to survive in the shadow of Drakkenheim.
        
- **Connection to Emma**:  
    **Emma**, who gave your party the initial tour of Emberwood Village, is **Tobias’s daughter**. During one visit, she was spotted **sitting at a table doing schoolwork with her mother**.
    

## Location Events

- You’ve visited the smithy for **gear purchases and armor upgrades**, especially early in your campaign.
    
- It's one of the places recommended for **armor purchases** in town (alongside _Aldor the Immense_ for magical items and _Orson’s Shop_ for trade goods).
    
- During a search for members of the **Favored Few**, your group encountered someone named **Sheldon**, said to be a member of that group, who had apparently passed through or been associated with the smithy.
    
- There was at least one discussion about how the **Ironhelms** — dwarves operating deeper in Drakkenheim — had **reopened another Smithy** in _The Spokes_, which may soon compete with or even eclipse the utility of Crow and Sons for high-end gear.
    
- Despite its shortcomings in refinement, Crow and Sons remains the **default smithy for Emberwood-based adventurers**.
