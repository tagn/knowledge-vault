## Description

This is the fortification where the [[Ironhelm]] family is held up. They mine [[Delerium]] from [[The Scar]] and process it here.

It has three gun platforms around the perimeter, each featuring a massive dwarven cannon.

The furnace is used to manufacture ammunition, fix up their gear. [[Mordecai Ironhelm]] hangs out around it during the evening.

There is a small office with blueprints, a desk, some plans. Our group had a peek inside. [[Reginald Ironhelm]] is normally inhabiting the office.

There is a small camp around the bonfire for cooking and resting.

The east barricade is the larger of the two. It covers the open side of the building and exposed campsite. A small wooden fence with barbed wire and spikes. Several burlap sacks up on the wall to perch muskets. [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] is typically there during the night.

The west barricade doesn't have a gate, it protects the long end of the smithy towards [[The Scar]].

There is a roof covering the office, the gap between the furnace and office, and the area around the furnace.
