## Description

**Hendrick’s Farm** is a **secluded farmstead** located **south of Emberwood Village**, and for a time, it served as the **primary operational hub** of the **Church of the Falling Fire**. It was the site of early sermons, conversions, rituals, and quiet power consolidation before the faction publicly staked its claim in Drakkenheim.

It’s one of those “**not on most maps**” kind of places — ordinary on the surface, but saturated with the **simmering zealotry** of a faith in ascension. Though pastoral in setting, the farm was a **crucible of heresy**, where **Delirium was studied, worshipped**, and used to **transform faith into flame**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Geographic Instability**:
    
    - The distance between Emberwood and Hendrick’s Farm seems to fluctuate wildly — **sometimes a 15-minute walk**, other times **a grueling two-hour trek**.

        
- **The Farmstead**:
    
    - Likely includes a **main house**, **barn**, and **cleared farmland**, repurposed into **makeshift housing, ritual spaces**, or **storage for Delirium**.
        
    - Structures would have been **modestly fortified**, enough to hold meetings and defend against wild creatures — but not a full-on fortress.
        
- **Religious Activity**:
    
    - The Church used Hendrick’s as a **quiet recruitment center**. Converts were **indoctrinated**, trained, and possibly exposed to **small doses of Delirium**.
        
    - Early rituals, including **mutagenic blessings**, may have begun here long before they were publicly performed at the **Chapel of Saint Ardenna** or **Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio**.
        

## Location Events

- **Early Church Operations**:
    
    - Before claiming the Cathedral, the **Church of the Falling Fire ran its operations out of Hendrick’s Farm**.
        
    - Here, figures like **Ophelia Reed** and **Flamekeeper Hannah** likely gathered, planned, and spread doctrine quietly, away from the scrutiny of the Lanterns and Academy.
        
- **You Were Sent Here Early On**:
    
    - Likely for **diplomatic, investigatory, or resource-gathering purposes**. Your early interactions with the Church probably began here.
        
    - What may have seemed like a **quaint rural compound** was quickly revealed to be **a node of something much larger and more dangerous**.
        
- **Post-Cathedral Transition**:
    
    - After the Church seized control of the **Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio**, Hendrick’s Farm appears to have been **abandoned as a primary base**.
        
    - Whether it’s still used for **off-the-books rituals**, **Delirium storage**, or **quiet conversions** is unclear — but it’s unlikely the Church would _completely_ give up such a foundational site.
