## Description

The **Shrine of the Old Gods** is a **remote, sacred site located north of Castle Drakken**, deep within the **Drakkenheim Wilds**. It predates the Sacred Flame, the Church of the Falling Fire, and likely the city of Drakkenheim itself. Here, **nature, death, and the forgotten divine** all intertwine — and **Old Zoya**, a **powerful elven druid or priestess**, serves as its solitary guardian.

The shrine is less a constructed temple and more a **natural convergence point**: stone circles, twisted roots, rune-carved trees, and an air so thick with ancient power it **warps time and memory**. It exudes a primal stillness — **the kind that makes you whisper without knowing why**.

It’s one of the **only places known to offer true healing from the Haze’s corruption**, but it is not without cost. Zoya demands **sacrifices, offerings**, or perhaps simply **endurance of the truth she embodies**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Sacred Grove / Stone Circle**:
    
    - The shrine is built into the landscape — **no walls, no altars**, just **ancient standing stones**, possibly of elven or pre-elven origin.
        
    - The area around it seems **resistant to the Haze**, not through sterilization, but through **deep natural magic** — like it digests corruption rather than repelling it.
        
- **Living Relics and Spirits**:
    
    - Some who enter the shrine report seeing **ghostly figures**, **animal spirits**, or even **their own past/future selves**.
        
    - Time is loose here. So is identity.
        
    - One might walk in seeking healing and come out **changed — healed, mutated, enlightened, or broken.**
        
- **Old Zoya**:
    
    - A **centuries-old elven woman**, referred to simply as **Zoya** or **Old Zoya**.
        
    - She is not aligned with any faction. She **serves the Old Gods** — or perhaps **is one** in disguise.
        
    - Her demeanor ranges from serene to cryptic to terrifying. She **demands respect**, and offers **powerful healing**, including **cleansing Delirium corruption**, possibly even **raising the dead** — but only when the balance demands it.
        
    - **Neutral but not passive**. Zoya does not take sides in factional squabbles — but she watches, and she remembers.

    - Members of your party have traveled here to **cleanse corruption**, **recover from traumatic encounters**, or **seek answers** when other avenues were closed.
        
    - Healing from Zoya is **not transactional** in the usual sense. It may involve **ritual, sacrifice, or vision quests**.
