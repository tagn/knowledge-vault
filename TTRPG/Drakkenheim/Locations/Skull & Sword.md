## Description

The **Skull & Sword** is a **dingy, violent, and magically warded tavern** located in **Emberwood Village**, and serves as a **front for the Queen’s Men**. It’s not subtle — the place **looks cursed**, smells like blood and regret, and makes no effort to clean itself up for outsiders. If the **Bark & Buzzard** is the adventurer's bar, and the **Gilded Lily** is the performance lounge, then the Skull & Sword is **where you go to make a deal you’ll regret or pick a fight you won’t finish**.

The tavern is known for its **magical warding**, **loose criminal enforcement**, and being a **hub of informants, enforcers, and cutthroat operators**. It is not a place of neutral ground — it’s **Queen’s Men turf**, and unless you're working with them, you're being watched.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Skull Above the Door**:
    
    - A literal skull mounted over the entrance — not decorative.
        
    - Anyone who **enters without properly addressing it** is subjected to **minor psychic agony**, a **curse-like punishment** that makes the tavern feel immediately hostile.
        
    - The ritual to address it likely involves **a phrase, gesture, or mark**, known to Queen’s Men and allies.
        
- **Interior Atmosphere**:
    
    - Dark, smoke-stained, and coated in layers of grime.
        
    - Tables are **scratched with blade marks**, drinks are **probably toxic**, and the **bartender doesn’t ask questions** — or wait long for gold.
        
    - There’s likely a backroom or two for **private meetings**, and maybe a hidden exit for when a deal goes sideways.
        
- **Queen’s Men Presence**:
    
    - While not overtly staffed by the Queen’s inner circle, this is where **foot soldiers, enforcers, and informants** hang out.
        
    - Lower-ranking gang members operate here freely, and **violence is tolerated**, so long as it doesn’t interrupt Queen-sanctioned business.
        

## Location Events

- **First Visit – “The Dip”**:
    
    - One of your party members, **Keth**, triggered an event referred to as **“The Dip”** here.
        
    - She was subsequently **kidnapped**, **blindfolded**, and taken to **Buckle Down Row**, implying the tavern serves as **an intake point or proving ground** for Queen’s Men recruits.
        
    - This suggests the Skull & Sword is more than a bar — it’s a **vetting mechanism**, possibly monitored for **loyalty or instability**.
        
- **Party’s Use of the Space**:
    
    - While not your default hangout, the Skull & Sword has been used for **surveillance, interaction with Queen’s Men contacts**, and as a location where **messages and packages might be exchanged**.
        
    - The atmosphere and magical deterrents make it clear that **you're welcome only as long as you're useful** — and no longer.
