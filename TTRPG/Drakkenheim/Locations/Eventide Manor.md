## Description

**Eventide Manor** is a **seemingly abandoned and dilapidated manor house** located within **Emberwood Village**. From the outside, it looks like just another ruin — weathered, boarded up, and long-forgotten. But the party quickly discovered that appearances were **actively misleading**.

Inside, the manor is **far from abandoned**. The interior is in good condition, even luxurious in places, and inhabited by an **unknown individual (or entity)** capable of **high-level magical manipulation**, particularly related to **space, secrecy, and illusion**. This resident has not fully revealed themselves, and their motives remain unclear, but their **power is unmistakable**.

It exists as a **pocket of mystery** in the otherwise pragmatic Emberwood — untouched by factional control, unclaimed by the Lanterns, and avoided by most villagers either out of superstition or subtle compulsion.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Magically Protected Interior**:  
    Once inside, the manor reveals itself to be **well-furnished**, **clean**, and **strangely timeless**.
    
    - The entrance may be **warded**, **illusory**, or simply protected by **enchantment that discourages attention**.
        
    - The very existence of the interior seems to **contradict the exterior state** — a classic hallmark of **extra-dimensional space** or **illusion magic**.
        
- **Unidentified Inhabitant**:
    
    - The being residing in the manor has **never been fully seen**, though your party has confirmed their presence.
        
    - What little interaction you’ve had implies a **neutral-to-curious attitude**, not immediately hostile but clearly **watchful**.
        
    - This figure possesses **powerful magical abilities**, possibly **divination, illusion, or planar magic**.
        
- **No Faction Control**:
    
    - The manor is notably **not under Hooded Lantern control**, nor claimed by the Church, Queen’s Men, or the Academy.
        
    - Its neutrality — or its being left alone — may be enforced through fear, magical coercion, or an **unspoken understanding** among those in the know.
