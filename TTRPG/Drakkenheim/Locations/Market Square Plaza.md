## Description

**Market Square Plaza** is a **central open-air plaza within the city of Drakkenheim**, situated directly **outside the ruined Clocktower**. Once a bustling center of trade and civic activity before the meteor strike, it is now a space **twisted by planar magic, temporal instability**, and **fiendish interference**.

The plaza has become a **key location in your party’s deeper descent into the city’s mysteries**, particularly following your **re-activation of the Clocktower**. What had once been a collapsed and dangerous ruin is now… different — possibly restored, possibly an illusion, possibly something far worse.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Clocktower**:
    
    - Dominates the edge of the square. After your party successfully **powered it**, the entire area underwent a **radical transformation**.
        
    - The tower itself is now **lit, functional**, and possibly affecting the **perception or flow of time** within the square.
        
- **Fiendish Hell Temple**:
    
    - A **sudden, unnatural structure** appeared within the plaza after the Clocktower was powered.
        
    - Its architecture was **twisted, infernal**, and entirely out of place — something **summoned or manifested**, not built.
        
    - Inside, the party encountered **Milando**, a **fiend** of unknown rank and allegiance, whose presence confirmed that **infernal forces are now active players** in Drakkenheim’s unraveling reality.
        
- **Temporal/Illusory Restoration**:
    
    - Following the Clocktower’s activation, Market Square Plaza now **appears restored** to its **pre-fall grandeur** — clean stonework, intact fountains, even the faint sense of normalcy.
        
    - However, this is **almost certainly illusion**, dream-state, or some form of **reality overlay**.
        
    - The transformation may be a **side effect of the Clocktower**, an act of planar bleedthrough, or the **influence of the fiend Milando himself**.
        

## Location Events

- **Encounter with Milando**:
    
    - The party entered the newly manifested hell temple and encountered **Milando**, who spoke cryptically and **offered little clarity on his goals**.
        
    - His demeanor, while not overtly hostile, was **deeply unsettling**, and his presence alone implies that **infernal contracts or influences** may be spreading into the city.
        
    - It’s unclear whether Milando is acting alone, as an agent of a greater fiendish power, or as part of a faction not yet fully revealed.
        
- **Clocktower Activation**:
    
    - A major magical feat by the party — this action **altered the space-time perception** of the entire plaza.
        
    - It may have also triggered **latent enchantments** embedded in the ruins or allowed **cross-planar bleed** from realms like the Nine Hells, Feywild, or Shadowfell.
        
- **Ongoing Uncertainty**:
    
    - Market Square Plaza is now in a state of **uncanny beauty**, its restored nature giving off **the wrong kind of calm**.
        
    - Your party (and likely all factions watching the city) now **view this location as a new hotspot**, but **no one seems to understand what the Clocktower has truly awakened**.
