## Description

The **Red Lion Hotel** is the **premier inn and high-end lodging establishment** in **Emberwood Village**. In contrast to the rough-and-tumble feel of most taverns and shelters in the region, the Red Lion presents itself as a **place of quiet, class, and privacy** — assuming you can afford it, and have the clout to get through the door.

It’s a **stone-and-wood manor-style building**, likely renovated post-meteor by someone with wealth and taste, or at least a keen sense of who’s worth catering to in a town full of unstable adventurers and political agents. The Red Lion doesn’t advertise — it doesn’t need to. Everyone knows **who goes there, and who doesn’t**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Upscale Accommodations**:
    
    - Clean rooms, private suites, actual bathing basins, and probably something resembling a **functional kitchen and staff**.
        
    - It’s one of the **few places in Emberwood where you might actually be able to rest in peace**, if your name or gold carries enough weight.
        
- **Exclusive Clientele**:
    
    - Known to house high-profile individuals and faction operatives, including:
        
        - **River**, your liaison from the **Amethyst Academy**, often found here when in town.
            
        - **Ironhelm dwarves**, a group of **Delirium-mining specialists** and warriors who operate out of **The Spokes** within Drakkenheim.
            
            - Their presence here implies **wealth, influence**, and **a desire for neutral territory** to negotiate or unwind.
                
- **Faction Neutral Zone** (Unofficial):
    
    - While not explicitly declared, the Red Lion appears to serve as a **mutual ceasefire space** — especially between high-level faction representatives.
        
    - Any violence here would likely trigger **political fallout**, so it’s understood that this is **where enemies drink quietly in different corners**.
        

## Location Events

- **Interactions with River**:
    
    - Your party has met with **River** here, discussing missions, updates, and the Academy’s objectives in Drakkenheim.
        
    - Her presence here suggests she views the Red Lion as a **secure base of operations**, not just a hotel.
        
- **Observed Dwarven Activity**:
    
    - The **Ironhelm dwarves** are often seen here during their trips out of the city.
        
    - This might be where **delicate negotiations** happen — trade routes, Delirium sales, and potential alliances between the Academy and dwarven miners.
        
- **Social Positioning**:
    
    - While not hostile, the Red Lion has a **snooty reputation**. Adventurers like your party are not _always_ welcomed without connections, presentation, or coin.
        
    - That said, your reputation may have bought you a foot in the door, particularly through **River’s presence**.
