## Description

The **Drakkenheim Wilds** refers to the **unclaimed, perilous land surrounding the ruined city of Drakkenheim**, forming a buffer zone between the fractured remnants of civilization and the arcane nightmare at the city's heart. It includes **cracked roads, poisoned forests, twisted remnants of farmland**, and **decaying outposts** that have either been repurposed by factions or overrun by monsters.

This area exists **between the boundaries of organized power** (like Emberwood Village) and the chaos of the city proper. While **not yet fully consumed by the Haze**, the Wilds are **unpredictable, hostile**, and brimming with **residual contamination, wandering abominations, mutated wildlife**, and **splintered echoes of pre-meteor life**.

It’s also home to a number of **significant locations** tied to healing, resistance, and heresy.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

### Shrine of the Old Gods

- Located **north of Castle Drakken**, deep in the Wilds.
    
- Home to **Old Zoya**, an elvish druid or priestess with the ability to **heal Haze-borne contamination** — for a steep price.
    
- The shrine is tied to **pre-meteor religious traditions**, worshipping the **Old Gods** long before the Sacred Flame or Falling Fire faiths came to dominate.
    
- Said to possess **power over life and death**, and to be shielded from the worst of the Haze.
    

### Camp Dawn

- A **field camp and recovery point** two miles outside Drakkenheim, frequented by the **Knights of the Silver Order**.
    
- Used for **rest, resupply, and possibly resurrection**.
    
- A few individuals recovered from places like the **Black Ivory Inn** (e.g., **Anika Patel**) headed here for healing and debriefing.
    
- It represents one of the **few safe resting points** close to the city’s edge.
    

### Reed Manor

- Located on the **outer edges of the city**, possibly still within the Wilds depending on how you slice the map.
    
- Home to **Oscar Yorn**, the controversial potion maker who deals in **Aqua Delirium**, **necromancy**, and **forbidden alchemy**.
    
- The manor is **semi-defended**, surrounded by twisted land, and guarded by large bandaged figures that resemble **constructed brutes or ogres**.
    

### Travel Hazards

- Roads in the Wilds are rarely safe. Your party has faced:
    
    - **Haze-spawned abominations**, including **Haze Hulks**, **Haze Husks**, and worse.
        
    - **Mutated wildlife**, such as **giant rats** and **pirate-themed minotaurs**.
        
    - **Delerium contamination pockets**, arcane surges, and **ruined terrain** that hides threats or traps.
        

## Location Events

- **Crossings into the city** from the Wilds are risky but essential. You've:
    
    - Used a **magic-assisted river crossing** from the Black Ivory Inn side.
        
    - Ventured through tunnels under **Buckle Down Row** and **the inn**, surfacing in high-risk zones like **Slaughter Stone Square**.
        
- **Oscar Yorn’s erratic supply behavior** (and fractured alliances between the Amethyst Academy and Hooded Lanterns) brought you deeper into the Wilds to confront him.
    
- You've brought **contaminated or mutated allies out of the city** and into the Wilds for treatment, particularly via **Old Zoya** at the Shrine of the Old Gods.
    
- Several **random encounter failures** during travel through the Wilds have resulted in near-death situations, ambushes, and strange events that suggest the **Haze is slowly spreading**.
