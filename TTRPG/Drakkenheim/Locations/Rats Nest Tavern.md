## Description

The **Rat’s Nest Tavern** is a **ruined and infested tavern** located in the **outer city of Drakkenheim**, and served as one of the **first major urban incursion points** for your party. Though originally a standard drinking hole for Drakkenheim’s commoners, the building — like most of the outer city — has fallen into **decay, corruption**, and **monstrous infestation** since the meteor strike.

Now, it is barely recognizable as a tavern. It’s a **collapsed structure**, **half-choked with rubble**, and **teeming with giant rats** and other Haze-mutated vermin. If anything still functions here, it’s by accident. The name is **no longer a nickname — it’s a warning**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Vermin Infestation**:
    
    - The building was overrun by **giant rats**, likely mutated by prolonged exposure to **Delirium and the Haze**.
        
    - You may have also encountered **ratlings or rat swarms**, suggesting this site is a **breeding ground for low-level Haze creatures**.
        
- **Trapped Basement or Lower Level**:
    
    - The structure likely has **a cellar or sub-level**, where prisoners or victims had been trapped by the rats.
        
    - The confined space and wreckage made it an **ambush-heavy zone**, limiting movement and vision during the encounter.
        

## Location Events

- **Rescue of Petra Lang**:
    
    - This was the site of the **rescue mission for Petra Lang**, a captive who had gone missing within the outer city.
        
    - Petra is a member of the **Hooded Lanterns** and the **sister of Ansom Lang**, their captain.
        
    - Her recovery **cemented your early alliance with the Hooded Lanterns**, earning their trust (for a time) and granting you **access to further missions and resources**.
        
    - Petra’s rescue also revealed how even **“low-tier” ruins near the city’s edge** could be fatal without planning, coordination, and luck.
        
- **First Taste of the Outer City**:
    
    - Rat’s Nest Tavern marked the **transition from Emberwood excursions to real incursions** into Drakkenheim.
        
    - The environment was more hostile, the threats less forgiving, and the rewards correspondingly higher — if you lived.
