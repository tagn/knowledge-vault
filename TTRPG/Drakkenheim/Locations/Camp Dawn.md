## Description

**Camp Dawn** is the **military encampment and operational base** for the **Knights of the Silver Order**, located roughly **two miles outside the city of Drakkenheim**, on the edge of the Wilds. It functions as both a **forward operating base** and a **recovery zone**, where the Knights regroup, treat the wounded, and prepare their next incursions into the city.

The camp is **structured, heavily disciplined, and devout**, reflecting the **knightly ideals of the Sacred Flame** before its fracturing. While not as entrenched as Emberwood Village, Camp Dawn radiates an **austere sense of purpose** — there are **no taverns, no gambling**, and certainly no Queen’s Men. Just **holy warriors on a mission**.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Tent Encampment and Fortifications**:
    
    - Consists of **orderly rows of tents**, **wooden palisades**, and **watchtowers**, set up in a defensible position against monsters or Haze creatures.
        
    - Likely includes **medical tents**, **supply depots**, and **training grounds** for initiates and veterans alike.
        
- **Healing and Resurrection Site**:
    
    - Camp Dawn is where **Anika Patel** and others recovered after being rescued from places like the **Black Ivory Inn**.
        
    - It is one of the **few places outside the city** where **resurrections or divine healing** may be available, albeit likely restricted to those aligned with the Silver Order or their values.
        
- **Doctrine of Purity**:
    
    - The Knights here follow a strict interpretation of the Sacred Flame — they see **Delirium as heresy**, **mutation as corruption**, and **the Haze as a holy blight** to be **purged, not studied or worshipped**.
        
    - Expect **judgment, not forgiveness**, especially if you're tainted, mutated, or aligned with heretical factions like the **Church of the Falling Fire**.
        

## Location Events

- **Fallen Allies Recovered Here**:  
    Survivors from the **Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio** conflict — like **Anika Patel** — were brought here for healing. The fact that some made it back here suggests **logistical control over safe routes**, even close to the city.
    
- **Factional Struggle**:  
    After their **defeat at the Cathedral**, the Knights regrouped at Camp Dawn. Their **military presence may be diminished**, but the **faith and discipline remain**.
    
    - You can expect them to be **gearing up for another assault**, or tightening defenses in anticipation of retaliation from the Church of the Falling Fire.
        
- **Your Party’s Relationship**:  
    Depending on your actions during the Cathedral conflict and affiliations with other factions (especially the **Amethyst Academy** or **Falling Fire**), you may be **viewed with suspicion or hostility**.
    
    - However, some individuals you've encountered — like Anika — may remain **sympathetic** or at least **pragmatic**.
