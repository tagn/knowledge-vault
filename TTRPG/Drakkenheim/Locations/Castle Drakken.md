## Description

**Castle Drakken** was once the **seat of power for the city of Drakkenheim**, likely serving as both a **royal residence and military stronghold**. Now, it looms in the distance, **shrouded in a thick, near-permanent Haze** — a region so dense with arcane contamination that even seasoned adventurers give it wide berth.

Very little concrete information exists about its current state. It stands more as a **symbol of what was lost**, and an obvious **endgame destination** for any group looking to unravel the city’s deepest secrets or confront whatever force corrupted it in the first place.

The castle is **heavily protected by supernatural or environmental forces**, and while you’ve caught glimpses of it, **no one in your party has approached it directly** yet.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Deep Haze Saturation**:  
    The area around Castle Drakken is described as having **one of the most intense concentrations of the Haze** in the region.
    
    - This likely implies **extreme mutation risks**, **hostile environmental magic**, and **inhospitable resting conditions**.
        
    - Standard rules for travel, rest, or even planar stability may not apply here.
        
- **Flying Entities**:  
    During your approach across the river, **flying figures or creatures were seen circling the castle**. This implies:
    
    - Airborne patrols or corrupted creatures.
        
    - Possible magical guardians or trapped souls.
        
- **Shrine of the Old Gods – North of Castle Drakken**:  
    You heard from Queen’s Men that **an elvish druid** of immense power resides near the castle in a **Shrine of the Old Gods**.
    
    - They allegedly hold sway over **life and death**.
        
    - This druid may represent a **neutral or alternative power** in the city, distinct from the major factions.
      
## Location Events

- While you haven’t directly visited the castle, you’ve:
    
    - **Observed it from a distance** (notably from across the river, near the Black Ivory Inn).
        
    - **Discussed it with various factions**, all of whom treat it as either off-limits or “to be dealt with later.”
        
    - Learned of its **strategic and symbolic value** — any faction that controls Castle Drakken likely controls the entire city.
        
- The **Queen of Blades**, **Hooded Lanterns**, **Amethyst Academy**, and **Knights of the Silver Order** all seem to orbit its significance, even if none claim to hold it.
