## Description

The **Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio** is a towering, ancient structure in Drakkenheim, formerly one of the most important religious sites for the **Sacred Flame**. Before the fall of the city, it would have stood as a **beacon of faith, power, and tradition** — a spiritual cornerstone amidst the political rule from Castle Drakken.

Since the meteor strike, it had been **lost to the Haze**, its halls tainted by arcane fallout, twisted faith, and corruption. But its importance never waned. For the **Church of the Falling Fire**, it represented both a holy site and a rallying symbol of legitimacy.

The cathedral has **now been reclaimed**, though not without immense bloodshed. The site was the stage for a **major factional clash** between the **Church of the Falling Fire** and the **Knights of the Silver Order**, both drawn to the cathedral’s symbolic and strategic significance — and driven by **fundamentally opposing goals** regarding the Haze and its “divine” nature.

The cathedral is no longer just a religious site — it’s now a **locus of power**, a symbol of **fanaticism triumphing over tradition**, and a potential **crucible for what the city will become**.
