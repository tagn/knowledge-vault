## Description

**Champion’s Gate** is one of the **major city gates leading into Drakkenheim**, and was once held by the **Garmyr**, a savage and brutal mutant warband native to the chaos of the city. The gate was **reclaimed in a large-scale assault** led by the **Knights of the Silver Order**, with support from **multiple factions** — including your party — in one of the few moments of tenuous, hard-won unity.

The victory was significant: Champion’s Gate became a **forward foothold into the city**, a **symbol of resistance**, and a rare instance of factional cooperation. But like most victories in Drakkenheim, **it didn’t last**.

Following the **catastrophic battle at the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio**, the Knights were **broken, scattered, or killed**, and their forces were **forced to abandon Champion’s Gate**. Now, the once-triumphant location stands **largely empty**, exposed to the creeping Haze and whatever horrors stir in the ruins.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Reinforced Gate Structure**:
    
    - After its reclamation, the Knights established **palisades, staging tents, and siege reinforcements**, turning it into a functioning forward base.
        
    - These defenses now stand mostly **unmanned**, slowly falling into disrepair or being picked apart by scavengers and monsters.
        
- **Former Garmyr Stronghold**:
    
    - Before its liberation, the gate and surrounding district had been **brutally fortified by the Garmyr**, using a combination of **brute-force engineering and warped magical traps**.
        
    - Signs of their occupation — **impaled bodies**, **ritual graffiti**, and **makeshift spike walls** — may still be visible.
        
- **Post-Abandonment Decay**:
    
    - With the Knights gone, **no faction has reclaimed it**.
        
    - The gate is vulnerable, haunted by what remains — **stragglers, scavengers, Garmyr remnants**, or worse.

    - One of the campaign’s most tactically significant engagements.

    - After the assault, Champion’s Gate became a **launch point for expeditions deeper into the city**, especially by the Silver Order.

- **After the Cathedral Siege**:
    
    - The **Knights' defeat at the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio** shattered their momentum and their numbers.

    - The gate now stands as a **monument to squandered hope**, a husk of a former triumph.
