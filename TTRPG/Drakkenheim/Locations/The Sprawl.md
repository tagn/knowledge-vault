## Description

**The Sprawl** is a **crumbling residential district** in the **outer city of Drakkenheim**, consisting mostly of **collapsed tenements**, **abandoned homes**, and **tangled alleyways**. Before the meteor, it would have been a **working-class neighborhood**, housing artisans, laborers, and minor merchants. After the fall, it became a **ruinous dead zone**, known for **feral creatures**, **unstable structures**, and **little to no factional presence**.

It’s an early benchmark in the campaign — a place where the party first confronted the reality that **even the "outer" parts of Drakkenheim are far from safe**. The Sprawl doesn't kill you with style — it kills you with rats, gravity, and bad luck.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Collapsed Residences**:
    
    - The area is filled with **roofless homes, crushed buildings**, and **unstable flooring** — a literal death trap in many areas.
        
    - Many of the interiors have **rotting furniture**, **discarded heirlooms**, and sometimes **mutated squatters**.
        
- **Minimal Faction Control**:
    
    - The **Hooded Lanterns**, **Queen’s Men**, and **Silver Order** have little presence here.
        
    - This makes The Sprawl a tempting spot for **small gangs**, **rogue mages**, or **creatures shaped by the Haze** to establish a foothold.
        
- **Delirium Traces and Arcane Residue**:
    
    - Not a Delirium hotbed by mining standards, but the area is contaminated enough to **spawn mutations** and **trigger magical effects**.
        
    - Broken spellwork and strange arcane echoes can still linger in the air.
        

## Location Events

- **One of the Party’s First Expeditions**:
    
    - The Sprawl was among the **first districts you entered** during your deeper dives into Drakkenheim.
        
    - It served as your **trial by fire** — a test of combat coordination, exploration logistics, and **encounter management** in Haze terrain.
        
- **Grummish's Intel**:
    
    - You obtained directions or hints about The Sprawl from **Grummish**, the bugbear from the **Gentlemen Bastards**, at the **Bark & Buzzard**.
        
    - His insights suggested the Sprawl was an **underrated danger zone** — not as glamorous as Buckle Down, but **more lethal than it looked**.
        
- **Encounters with Mutated Wildlife or Haze Spawns**:
    
    - Your group likely encountered **giant rats**, **Haze Husk-type creatures**, or **aberrations hiding in the wreckage**.
        
    - These early fights helped set the tone: **even the lowest-tier threats in Drakkenheim are not to be underestimated**.
        
- **Initial Looting and Scavenging**:
    
    - Your party may have recovered **minor magical items, scrolls, heirlooms**, or **fragments of lore** from households left untouched for decades.
        
    - But the real treasure was **survival experience** — learning how to navigate, loot, and retreat with your lives intact.
