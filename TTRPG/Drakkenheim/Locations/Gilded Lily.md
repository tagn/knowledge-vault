## Description

The **Gilded Lily** is a **more upscale tavern and inn** located in **Emberwood Village**, catering to adventurers and townsfolk who prefer a touch of elegance (or at least clean chairs and drinks without blood in them). It's the kind of place that **thinks it's classy**, but still operates under the gritty, survivalist conditions of a town bordering a cursed ruin.

While it's no Red Lion Hotel, it presents itself as the **“nicer” option** compared to places like the **Bark & Buzzard** or **Skull & Sword**. Adventurers with coin, flair, or ambition find their way here — especially those looking to build a **reputation** as well as a kill count.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Talent Stage**:  
    The Gilded Lily is known for hosting **regular talent competitions**, complete with a **stage** and some form of **prize or recognition**.
    
    - It’s one of the few venues where **performance and social skill matter** more than brute strength (at least temporarily).
        
    - The competitions draw **locals, fellow adventurers, and talent-starved weirdos**, making it a hotspot for charisma-based chaos.
        
- **Decent Accommodations**:  
    The tavern offers **rooms for rent** that are **cleaner and safer than average** — useful for short stays if you don’t want to risk sleeping in the Chapel or your abandoned home under disguise.
    
- **Food and Drink**:  
    Generally **higher quality** than the Bark & Buzzard.
    
    - Prices are steeper, but they **buy you peace**, or at least **less blood in your ale**.
        
- **Clientele**:
    
    - A mix of **flashier adventurers**, **bards**, **wannabe nobles**, and **posturing rookies** trying to stand out.
        
    - You’re more likely to meet someone who talks about slaying a Haze Hulk than someone who actually has.
