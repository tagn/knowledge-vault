## Description

**Shepard’s Gate** is one of the **major fortified entrances into the outer city of Drakkenheim**, and serves as a **strategic foothold** for the **Hooded Lanterns**. Situated along one of the few partially intact roads leading from **Emberwood Village into the ruins**, it marks the border between the **relative safety of the outskirts** and the **mutated, crumbling deathtrap that is the city proper**.

Heavily guarded and frequently reinforced, the gate functions as both a **choke point and a checkpoint**, regulating who and what enters the city — and what comes back out. The Hooded Lanterns use it as a **forward command post**, supply depot, and staging ground for patrols and recovery missions.

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **Fortifications and Watchtowers**:
    
    - The gate has been **reinforced with makeshift barricades, wood-and-metal watch platforms**, and possibly some **light siege gear or mounted crossbows**.
        
    - Guards are rotated frequently, and shifts are long — the area sees **constant pressure from monsters, mutants, and rival factions**.
        
- **Checkpoint Culture**:
    
    - Adventurers passing through Shepard’s Gate are typically **logged, questioned**, and **tagged with risk assessments**.
        
    - Returning groups are **decontaminated (poorly)** and interrogated about what they saw, who they met, and what they’re carrying.
        
- **Execution Square (Informal)**:
    
    - The area outside or just inside the gate has seen **public executions**, most notably that of **Wyldenten Proudsky**, who was **put to death by the Hooded Lanterns**.
        
    - His execution marked a **point of no return** for your party’s relationship with the faction — a shift from strained diplomacy to **open hostility or covert opposition**.
        

## Location Events

- **First Entry Into Drakkenheim**:
    
    - Shepard’s Gate was the **first passage your party used to formally enter the city**, making it the beginning of your deep descent into Drakkenheim’s horrors.
        
    - At the time, the Hooded Lanterns still regarded your group as allies, or at least useful assets.
        
- **Execution of Wyldenten Proudsky**:
    
    - After a series of controversial events (and presumably some publicized magical instability or political threat), Wyldenten was **captured, tried, and executed** at the gate.
        
    - His **death was a public spectacle**, whether for deterrence or propaganda, and **cast a long shadow** over your party’s reputation and internal morale.
        
    - It symbolized not just the end of a character, but a **narrative shift** from exploration to vengeance, mistrust, or even full rebellion.
        
- **Current Status**:
    
    - Shepard’s Gate is still **controlled by the Hooded Lanterns**, and **approaching it openly is now perilous** for your group.
        
    - You’ve used **alternative routes, tunnels, disguises**, or **bribery** to avoid it in later incursions.
