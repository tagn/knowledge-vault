## Description

**Caravan Park** is the **merchant and trading hub** of Emberwood Village — a dusty, bustling space in the center of town where **wagons circle up**, **market stalls cluster**, and **informal storefronts pop up around a boarded-up water well**. It serves as the **economic lifeline** of the village, drawing traveling merchants, relic hunters, and opportunists trying to flip anything from mundane goods to arcane curiosities.

Think of it like a **frontier trading post that grew into a semi-permanent bazaar**. While it’s not as secure or well-stocked as a formal marketplace, it’s where most goods are exchanged, information is bartered, and reputations are quietly made (or destroyed).

## Notable Landmarks or Features

- **The Boarded-Up Water Well**:  
    Centerpiece of the market. No one seems eager to unboard it, implying either danger or superstition.
    
- **Armin Gainsbury’s Stall**:
    
    - One of the first real NPCs you interacted with in the village.
        
    - Wears **thick bifocals**, straw hat, and has a **beanpole build**.
        
    - Comes off as a **shrewd, old-school trader** — probably overcharges.
        
    - Sells paper, pack animals, and general supplies.
        
    - Later received **custom customer loyalty cards** from Wyldenten Proudsky.
        
- **Fairweather Trades**:
    
    - Merchant source, referenced when looking for gems or components.
        
- **Orson’s Shop**:
    
    - May be synonymous with **Orson Fairweather**. Implication is he deals in rarer goods, possibly magical or at least “questionably sourced.”
        
- **Occasional Appearances by Eccentrics**:
    
    - **Azan the Wanderer**: Showed up here with a **15–20 foot-long walking steam wagon**.
        
        - Brought exotic items like **talking dogs**, **vials of spiders**, **magic tattoos**, and the **Goblin Cursing Bow**.
            
        - **Jaziel**, the armor-clad, talking dog companion, handled bartering.
            
        - After selling wares, Azan opened a portal and vanished — very _Planeswalker™ energy_.

    - **Brek Ironjaw**, thrown out of a nearby tavern and ripped in half by a **Haze Hulk**.
