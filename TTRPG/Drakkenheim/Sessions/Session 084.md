## Summary

## Event Log

- There's uhh, three dragons and some gargoyles.
- The dragons seem to have true sight. The gargoyles do not. They don't seem to go after Sihrr. There are a shitload of them to have to fight, so we need a way to get around them or 
- The dragons/etc might be mutated in some way by the Delerium.
- The defenses seem to still be responsive to the seals. They must see us as a threat of sort to have attacked us immediately like that.
- Ryan Greymere has some information about the castle.
	- Anyone carrying a seal is not considered an enemy.
	- Many generations ago, house von drakken commissioned them to put powerful magic wards upon the castle and the grounds.
	- As we get closer to the castle, a bright purple glow eminates from every window. It is not the haze, it blocks any line of sight from the outside into the castle.
	- Defenses are in place that prevent teleporting in/out of the Castle. You need a direct line of sight to your destination.
	- They will attack any enemy the travels up the road on foot, climbs more than halfway up the walls, flys over the walls. They will pursue relentlessly into the castle itself.
