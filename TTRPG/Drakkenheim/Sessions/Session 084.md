## Summary

## Event Log

- There's uhh, three dragons and some gargoyles.
- The dragons seem to have true sight. The gargoyles do not. They don't seem to go after Sihrr. There are a shitload of them to have to fight, so we need a way to get around them or 
- The dragons/etc might be mutated in some way by the Delerium.
- The defenses seem to still be responsive to the seals. They must see us as a threat of sort to have attacked us immediately like that.
- Ryan Greymere has some information about the castle.
	- Anyone carrying a seal is not considered an enemy.
	- Many generations ago, House von Drakken commissioned them to put powerful magic wards upon the castle and the grounds.
	- As we get closer to the castle, a bright purple glow emanates from every window. It is not the haze, it blocks any line of sight from the outside into the castle.
	- Defenses are in place that prevent teleporting in/out of the Castle. You need a direct line of sight to your destination.
	- They will attack any enemy the travels up the road on foot, climbs more than halfway up the walls, or fly over the walls. They will pursue relentlessly into the castle itself.
	- If we do make it deep into the castle, they have put warding on the royal vaults itself.
- WE GET THE PHYLACTERY BOYS!!
	- She has a few conditions for it.
	- She would prefer if the Phylactery is not used to harm anyone that she considers innocent, or unsure on their path of their religious journey.
	- The only other request is that whichever one of us chooses to utilize it, will pledge that we won't sell or offer it in trade.
- The Queen may have another seal, perhaps we can make a deal with her for it. Otherwise our options are get it from Ryan Greymere, get it from Elias Drexxel, or perhaps stick one of us into a bag and carry them in, but that's risky if we need to be within the castle grounds.
