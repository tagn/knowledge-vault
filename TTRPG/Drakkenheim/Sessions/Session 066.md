## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up with Grannie about to go down, Milando just made a deal with Keth to spare Grannie.
- Keth gets sucked into the bag. Silas also gets sucked into the bag. The ghostly hand seems to be on the end of a tongue. 
- Sihrr opens the bag with telekinesis and flips the bag over to get us out. Arken has to help Silas get out the rest of the way as the creatures tongue grabs him.
- Arken and Sihrr go look for the head of Grannie as it floated down the [[River]].
- Milando came in/out via a summoning circle thingy at Grannies house.
- We slowly make our way into Grannies house. The house smells of decay and rotting wood.
- Silas casts identify on the Pestle. It's a Natural weapon. Does bludgeoning damage and can cause the target have to make a save or get disadvantage on concentration checks.
- Inside grannies house we find:
	- The phylactery of saint vitruvio. It's under a pile of discarded items in the corner of the room.
	- An amulet with a mirror in it: Gives you advantage on charisma checks at night.
	- Two hobgoblin feet that are stuck together at the soles: The orphan feet. If you bite a toe off and throw the other foot up to 30 feet. It can be used 5 times. 
	- A magical ring. Plain silver: Identify does not work on this ring. 
	- A severed arm of a troll: Acts as an alchemy jug. You have to slit the wrist.
	- A severed head of a water elemental, a marid: A decanter of endless water. You have to pry the eyelids off and it cries out the water.
	- A long iron needle: An iron needle you have to slam into your eye. It proof against detection and location.
	- A pointed bone tube: A water breathing tube. A themed version of the "cap of water breathing". While wearing it, it makes a bubble of air around your head. To get it to function, you have to stab it into your throat. 
	- An eye that constantly looks around. The lid never closes: Flavored Driftglobe. A small sphere, within 60 feet you can speak a command word and cause it to emanate light or the daylight spell. Once a day.
	- A glass spider: Opens any lock. 8 legs. Each use consumes a leg
	- A deck of 20 of 22 playing cards: The lights in the room dim. Silas is hit with an overwhelming sense of power. This is a deck of many things. Two cards were removed. Once a card is drawn it fades from existence, unless it's the fool or jester. We drew 3 of the cards so far.
	- A large black box, about three feet deep, a foot wide: Inside are three featureless dolls. Dolls of Parody. If attuned to them, they'll take the shape of each member of the party and start acting like dumb versions of each of the other party members.
	- The flesh bag of horrors: Identity works, but doesn't give me any information.
- Arken finds a small rock with a hole in it, he can always hear wind from it.
- Silas finds a small pocket mirror that is perfect, whenever he picks it up it fogs over.
- Sihrr finds a small skull of a rabbit that whispers insults when nobody is looking at it.
- Keth finds a spinning top with an image of one of the four elements on each side.
- There is evidence that someone else has been sleeping in the area.
- Silas grabs some mystery hair from where he used to sleep. He finds a small envelope. Inside is a letter scrawled, "To my dearest grandson. If you are reading this. I have passed into the shadows. The cauldron is yours, guard it well. Be wary of those who come seeking it. It will bring sweet lies. In the hollow tree of the riverbank, there is a key to her hidden chest. The one eyed witch still owes her a favor. The forest remembers and will answer your call."
- We torch Casa del Grannie.
- We use legend lore on the Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio. It was originally created at the behest of Saint Vitruvio, who wanted to be bound to service for if aid was required in the future.
- We travel out of Grannies territory. Waiting for us at the edge of the territory is a very long line of fey deer. As we approach they bow towards us. They part in the middle and allow us to enter lady Frostgleams territory.
- Silas recalls that the dragon form of Lady Frostgleam is a crystal dragon. They are also known to be the friendliest of all dragonkind. We hop on her back and she flies us towards an ice covered mountain. We fly straight into the side of the mountain, which turns out to be illusionary. We're now in the inside of Lady Frostgleams home.
- "Nivra Chillheart" was the true name of Grannie.
- Silas hands over the envelope and key to Lady Frostgleam.
- We're offered rooms for the night, and Lady Frostgleam will help us get back to the material plane the following day.
- The servant led us to our rooms, the Lady left some token of appreciation for us in the dresser drawer.
- Keth looks through all the drawers. She finds a crystal with a glyph carved into it. This is our first "legendary" item. It is a legendary ion stone of mastery.
