## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up in the mausoleum right after the fight with the Gravekeeper.
- We inch around the room. The pillar looks very damaged. We notice the face of Johan Isner grafted onto it, very grossly. This is known as the foundation pillar. It is the power source for all of the castle wards. It is connected magically to pretty much every bit of magic in the castle. 
- The steward speaks to us:
	- The pillar is being drained of power by the rift above. I am doing my best to slow it, and have been for 15 years. If it can destroy the pillar, the rift will burst open and destroy the city. He's asking us about destroying the rift.
	- We could do something with the seals, investing the power of all of the seals into him, with them, he should be able to stabilize the pillar, but he'll be trapped inside of it forever.
	- The king has been dead for 15 years. Something joined with him.
	- The power source of the pillar is from before his time. He does not know the arcane details of it, just that it's supply is not infinite.
- The crown itself is the most powerful of all of the seals. With it, and if the rift is closed, we may be able to complete the coronation without.
- The steward requests that we don't aid the monster above.
	- With the seals invested in the steward, he may be able to return the guardians (dragon, etc..) and turn them upon the monsters in the castle and the city.
- Johan currently is just able to activate and deactivate some defenses, but has little power left. If he dies the pillar will not be able to contain the rift.
- Silas, Sihrr, and Elias Drexxel have Death Ward cast on them.
- We charge into the throne room.
- The sovern chamber has a 60ft ceiling, ringed by columns, supporting balcony 30 feet up.
- The throne itself is on a three tiered marble platform, flanked by warped statues of knights.
- Above the throne is a dimensional rift, leading to the space between worlds.
- Around the balcony, still in royal garb, are delerium dregs. Gibbering mouthers are spread throughout the room. Before the throne is a gibbering amalgamation, suspended between the ceiling and the floor. The mass is covered in bursting sores, and weeps bile and Delerium sludge through its pours. Dangling amongst the shit is the crown. Contamination emanates from the creature.
- We begin possibly the last combat of the game.
- Out of the portal, gibbering mouthers start spawning
- Top of the round, starts vibrating and gibbering mouther explodes.
- We slay the amalgamation, everything starts collapsing.
- Above the throne, through the rift, we can see the space between worlds.
- Character may only attune to the crown, each attuned to the
	- 3 charges, can expend 1 action to cast the wish spell
	- While wearing the crown he can command
- Sihrr wishes the portal closed.
- The portal collapses in on itself. The haze is not resolved.
- We attempt to resurrect Johan Isner, but he does not willingly accept the resurrection spell.
