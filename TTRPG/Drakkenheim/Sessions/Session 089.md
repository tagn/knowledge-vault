## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up in the mausoleum right after the fight with the Gravekeeper.
- We inch around the room. The pillar looks very damaged. We notice the face of Johan Isner grafted onto it, very grossly. This is known as the foundation pillar. It is the power source for all of the castle wards. It is connected magically to pretty much every bit of magic in the castle. 
- The steward speaks to us:
	- The pillar is being drained of power by the rift above. I am doing my best to slow it, and have been for 15 years. If it can destroy the pillar, the rift will burst open and destroy the city. He's asking us about destroying the rift.
	- We could do something with the seals, investing the power of all of the seals into him, with them, he should be able to stabilize the pillar, but he'll be trapped inside of it forever.
	- The king has been dead for 15 years. Something joined with him.
	- The power source of the pillar is from before his time. He does not know the arcane details of it, just that it's supply is not infinite.
- The crown itself is the most powerful of all of the seals. With it, and if the rift is closed, we may be able to complete the coronation without.
- The steward requests that we don't aid the monster above.
	- With the seals invested in the steward, he may be able to return the guardians (dragon, etc..) and turn them upon the monsters in the castle and the city.
- Johan currently is just able to activate and deactivate some defenses, but has little power left. If he dies the pillar will not be able to contain the rift.
