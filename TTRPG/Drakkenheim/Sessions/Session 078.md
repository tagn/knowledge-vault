## Summary

## Event Log

- We discuss things about our current situation.
- We head into the marketplace to scavenge around for if anything was restored.
- Nox finds a deck of 22 cards, that seem to be made of ivory.
- Walking to the Cathedral, in the distance we see the fully restored, pristine Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio
- After walking closer to the Cathedral, we suddenly step out of the "illusion" and its back to rubble.
- We stop a patrol near the Cathedral, they have seen the "restored" area, but are unsure about what's going on.
- In the Cathedral there is a meeting of [[Lucretia]], Eldrich Runeweaver, and representatives of the [[Queen's Men]].
- We fucked up our relationship with the [[Amethyst Academy]].
