## Summary

## Event Log

- We make another con save, [[Sihrr]] no longer has an arm, its a tentacle. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is covered with continuously popping boils.
- Statues in the garden appear to be of some mythological creatures.
- The garden seems to be tended by some sort of fey creatures. We make multiple failed attempts to ask them to provide us with some lilies.
- We wander into a more thickly wooded area inside the park.
- In the distance we spot some four floating lights, darting into the woods. We try to follow the creatures, they wander into a grove of glowing flowers. In the middle of the patch there is a body.
- The flowers don't appear to look like lilies, perhaps glowing roses.
- As we arrive in the grove, we see the glowing lights/creatures across from us.
- [[Seven]] attempts to use a rope and grappling hook to snag the body, but doesn't know how to throw shit.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] approaches the body and attempts to inspect it, but it apparently was some sort of apparition. He is rushed from behind by one of the balls of light, which shocks him.
- We prune a few of the glowing flowers off, but continue on.
- We leave the grove, into steps leading up to a raised platform. We walk up some steps towards some sort of statue.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] recalls the prior queen of [[Drakkenheim]] was very much about vanity, was very good to servants/etc..
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] checks out the statue of the Queen for anything interesting, no luck.
- We encounter some trolls that want us to give up a limb in exchange for the flowers.
- We kill one of them, the other one offers to parlay.
- He leads us to the "Eldritch [[Lily]] Pond" after we spare him.
- We see five more of the handmaidens standing in the water. We see two large flowers with the petals.
- The troll departs, and gives us directions to the other garden place.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] swaps with his echo to get close to the flowers, clicks the immovable rod in place to hang in the air, then grabs a flower. 
- These don't appear to be the flowers we were looking for.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] gained some more [[Contamination]] levels.
- We arrive at the Queen's Grotto.
- Every statue around here appear to be statues of the Queen, each statue's face is chiseled off. We see the presumably fake flowers. As we approach forwards, [[Sihrr]] hears some noise above.
- There appear to be large plantlike creatures up above, we decide not to fuck with them.
- We head into some door, then down some stairs into a chamber. There is a fountain in the middle. The walls are lined with a mosaic.
- [[Sihrr]] tastes the water, seems fine.
- We follow down the path to the left and find some of the Nymphs. They tell us their Queen is there, and she doesn't want guests.
- We go the other way, and enter a room full of statues. All of the statues appear to have had their faces carved off.
- We continue down the corridor and find a pond, Eldritch lilies are seen around the chamber. There seems to be some lavish shit.
- Chalky white skin, writhing mass of thick orange tendrils. Wears an emerald necklace, distressed black ball gown. Face covered with a cracked mask.
- Turns out it's the queen, and looking at her is not a good thing.
- We spend the next like two hours trying to make sure [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] didn't die
