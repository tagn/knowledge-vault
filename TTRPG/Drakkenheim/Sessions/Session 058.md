## Summary

## Event Log

- We decide to go speak with Ryan Greymere about access to the [[Inscrutable Tower]] to see if she can help us get in, and what information she has about it.
- We successfully convince Ryan Greymere to aid us in entering the tower if we successfully clear the grounds.
- She wants possession of the Inscrutable Staff, which was in possession of the previous Archmage, who is presumed dead.
- Ryan Greymere invites us into the Rose Theatre after we come to an agreement.
- Circular open air auditorium. A circular stage with a wooden platform at the north of the room. There is some sort of back stage area. In the center is a large [[Delerium]] Geode which seems to be what she uses to power the place.
- Ryan Greymere wants to "seal the city and farm the resources".
- On the stage she takes us up behind a wall and shows us an arcane apparatus.
	- Hoses go on the ground towards the [[Delerium]] crystal. 
	- There are wards/magic.
	- [[Silas]] takes some notes on the apparatus.
	- Ryan Greymere did research in the past in the Clock Tower regarding repairing it.
- [[Sihrr]] asked about information on Magical wards/etc.. In the tower, the machinery pre-dates the [[Amethyst Academy]] as well as current civilization.
	- The mechanism within the clock tower is a "fuck around and find out" situation. They don't know what the clock tower was for. There were some elvish sites with the same types of implements.
- Ryan Greymere shares some information with us:
	- The formation of [[Delerium]] crystals: Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances it crystalizes into the [[Delerium]] crystals. The magic comes from other dimensions. Larger quantities of [[Delerium]] have a greater effect. Uncontained the negative side-effects manifest into the [[Haze]]. More [[Delerium]] forms in the [[Haze]]. She expects within 200 years the entire planet would get covered in [[Delerium]] at its current growth.
	- As the [[Haze]] expands, it transforms the landscape and conjures magical energy in the space between worlds. If borders between worlds are already thin, it can cause catastrophic dimensional rifts.
	- [[Delerium]] presents an existential danger, but also an incredible opportunity. It can supply an infinite supply of magical energy. She has found promise in harnessing the energy coming off of the stones. If they are able to harness this it may even slow the growth of the [[Haze]].
	- She conjures a portal in the air and pulls out a box. She pulls out from the box a spherical glass orb. Inside of it is a burning [[Delerium]] shard, hovering. This is a creation of hers. If thrown it will shatter and release a very strong amount of contaminated energy in an area.
- In the tower:
	- We should enter into a large lobby. About 150 feet tall.
	- There should be elevators, which may or may not still be functional. Those lead up to the Great Hall, which was a meeting area used for large gatherings, etc..
	- Above that were dormitories for apprentices, research floors, the great library, and the apartments of the [[Amethyst Academy]] wizards. At the very top is the directors office and nexus.
		- The Nexus at the top of the tower seems to be some sort of powerful magical artifact/item/etc..
- We encounter some [[Delerium]] lookin' shits on the way to see Grandpa about his thoughts on the [[Haze]].
	- We encounter a [[Delerium]] Sludge monster and a creature seemingly made of Deep [[Haze]].
