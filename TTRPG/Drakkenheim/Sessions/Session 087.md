## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up back in the castle, on the second floor perhaps.
- Retcon - We actually have 60 feet vision.
- When the forcefield went up, everyone in the room, including the Queen, would have heard:
	- "Not yet. Save me."
- We ask the queen about where the King's Chambers would be. They should be two or three floors up from where we are. Below may be the vault, and mausoleum.
- We enter up the "Stair Tower".
	- At the first landing:
	- There are two arched walkways to the right, leading towards other towers.
	- To the left we see a hallway which terminates with stairs going up and down.
- Keth notices what might be an eye watching us. She also notices that the eye on her chest is closed.
- Keth finds a route leading downwards behind the fireplace in the first room on the left.
- Heading to the left, we find a sitting room, then to the left from that we see multiple Quasits.
- On the side of the wall, Silas notices some spores stuck to the wall. It's a residue of sorts. This is "veroc" poison. These are large flying vulture demons. We kill one, then head back towards
- There is no exit to the second floor here. 
- At the top of the stairs we find a ladder that goes to a hatch on the ceiling. We decide to head back down.
