## Summary

## Event Log

- We come back into the middle of a combat encounter.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] goes to aim the cannon at the big hulk that came from the south east and tells his spider to fall back.
- The [[Haze Hulk Juggernaut]] dashes to the north to get around some of our fortifications.
- Cannon stats are:
	- To hit: 1d20+?
	- Damage: 6d10
- Creatures arm gets blown off by the cannon shot, then charges through our defenses knocking a few people prone.
- We take down the large hulk, surprisingly it doesn't explode.
- We take a short rest while getting ourselves back in order for further events.
- We start to hear some wailing out in the distance.
- [[Sihrr]] scouts out a few creatures approaching [[The Smithy]].
	- To the south, he sees a [[Haze Hulk]] looking creature that appears more rotting than normal. It is wielding a large sword. It stands around 12-13 feet tall. It walks forward, rips out a chunk of its intestines, and throws it at [[Sihrr]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] on top of the roof.
	- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] takes a shot at the creature to the right. It has a sleek looking form with lots of tentacles. 
- Not knowing what to do, [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] casts detect magic to try to sort out if the creature that disappeared is nearby. He senses something south of him. The creature reappears in front of him and hits [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and a thug and pulls them in. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] flies over and hacks the thing to pieces. The creature explodes and infects those nearby with some [[Contamination]].
- We beat down the creatures and a chimera swoops down from above, breathing fire on the group and bringing [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] down out of the sky.
- We search the body of the Chimera, and find a few things worn as trophies:
	- Signet ring on one of its lion claws
	- Medallion around its neck
- [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] suggests that they can make some false teeth for [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] once we survive the night.
