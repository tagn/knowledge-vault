## Summary

## Event Log

- We arrive at "Grandfather's" estate
- The [[Pale Man]] threatens? [[Silas]]
- After being invited in, [[Silas]] hands [[Raven]] a set of children's books to give to [[Grunt]] to read to the children.
- Upon approaching a vat of soup, [[Pale Man]] forcibly makes some dregs drop their cleavers, severing eight toes in the process. One of the dregs reaches down and plops some of the toes into the soup.
- [[Silas]] asked how the "restored" dregs interact with the ones that are still wild, there does not appear to be a bond, it causes fights.
- The [[Pale Man]] has encountered some of the Garmyr before, but did not offer up much information about them. 
- We probe about "information" on [[River (AA)]] to entice her to come to us.
	- He comes back with a piece of paper with some writing in Abyssal on it, he offers that we tell her that she will receive the other half of the paper if she comes to meet.
	- [[Silas]] intends on using Comprehend Languages to read it tomorrow
- [[Pale Man]] grinds a fragment of Delirium to dust in his hand into a fine powder. He throws the powder in-front of him and makes a sphere of deep [[Haze]].
- [[Pale Man]] tells us that he thinks its possible to completely cure the mutagenic transformations. He mentions the [[Amethyst Academy]] closely guards the secrets of the "wish" spell
- Upon returning to the tower, the locks are gone. We find [[Milando]] up the tower. He asks for [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] to return the favor, he wants her to get a set of "[[Haze]] Walker Plate"
- He brings up the [[Rose Theatre]] in the city. It has been "transformed" and there is an Archmage in control of the area. "Armored head to toe, behind an impenetrable magic barrier"
- We discuss some things, then head to clear out the nearby bridge from the [[Clock Tower]]
- As we walk onto the bridge, a wall raises behind us, slowly creeping forward, shaking the entire bridge as we walk.
- [[Silas]] gets fucked with real nice and hard as usual, but we survive in the end.
