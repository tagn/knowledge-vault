## Summary

## Event Log

- We begin the session just exiting the mausoleum area.
- We discuss the possibility of only giving the [[Hooded Lanterns]] some of the flowers we found, we decide to just give them all over.
- Our party is stopped at the gate. A guard aims a crossbow at us, questions [[Seven]], finds out he is a friend of [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]]. He's told that [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] was a traitor for murder, [[Seven]] replies asking if they deserved it.
- We're escorted in to see [[Petra Lang]]. She's in the middle of painfully eating. 
- We give over the flowers, plus a few fake ones. We're offered a short rest. Nobody eats the food.
- After a brief discussion with [[Ansom Lang]], we depart and make our way back to [[Emberwood Village]].
- We encounter some members of what we perceive to be the [[Amethyst Academy]] performing some sort of research on a small [[Delerium]] deposit.
- No conflict with the group.
- We pass through [[Emberwood Village]] and go to [[Hendricks Farm]] to try to get some sort of healing for [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]].
- We go back to [[Emberwood Village]] to find [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] to see about curing [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]].
- [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] is deep in prayer next to the flame in the [[Chapel of Saint Ardenna]].
- We pay for the services to get our [[Contamination]] removed. [[Seven]] does not have to pay material costs, but pays 150 gold for the labor.
- Everyone gets healed up, [[Seven]] seems pretty much perfect.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] opens up the envelope that was waiting in front of her house. It's a letter written in Elvish, a dialect popular in the [[Underdark]]. It's a letter from her horrible dude, turns out he knows where she is.
- We go check on our house, get the keys from [[Emma]]. [[Seven]] buys a set of Scale Mail from the Crowe and Sons.
- We head over to [[Aldor the Immense]], there is a Drow next to him named [[Milando]], seems to be some other magic merchant. He beckons us to join him for a meal.
- [[Aldor the Immense]] shows us his inventory of what he's got for sale.
	- Some sort of pearl that might be able to hold magic.
	- A small purple stone, very bright. Can make you harder to hit
	- Pair of house slippers. Allows you to shift around the battlefield when you attack.
- We head into the [[Bark & Buzzard]], [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] is shown a light crossbow, she test fires it at [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] with a glass over his head shattering the glass.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] signs a contract exchanging the crossbow for an IOU. Definitely not ominous in any way.
- He then pulls out another box containing a wand that looks like a weather vane. It is a Wand of Wonder. It does *something* when you use it, but its not really clear what it does.
- He then pulls out a belt. It makes you healthier in some way, but has some side effects possibly. 2500 gold for it. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] buys it, turns out its a belt of dwarvenkind.
- We go and argue with the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves about getting back [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]]'s gun. They were complete dicks about it.
