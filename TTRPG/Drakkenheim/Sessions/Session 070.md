## Summary

## Event Log

- Tower likely inhabited by [[Delerium]] creatures which were a result of the deep [[Haze]]. 
- Lobby > Mess Hall > Dorms > Research Floors (Labs, Medical Ward, Scriptoriums)
- Legend lore
	- One of three strongholds of the [[Amethyst Academy]]. Greatest of the three
	- Tower was a mystery even before meteor
	- Nobody knows when it appeared in [[Drakkenheim]]. Must have been sometime after editcts of lumen.
	- The city was built around the tower, as a pre-existing structure before [[Drakkenheim]].
	- In truth, the inscrutable tower is an ancient and legendary hidden fortress of the sorcerer kings.
	- It's an extra-planar dungeon built within the Space Between Worlds in the past by powerful and insane sorcerers to protect and hide their knowledge.
	- Several hundred years ago, the [[Amethyst Academy]] tapped into the Nexus and shifted it into the mortal plane.
	- The Academy has removed knowledge of this.
	- The [[Amethyst Academy]] does not understand the forces holding the tower together even after the meteor hit.
	- The walls are made from various pieces of alloys, Obsidian, Dark Steel, Granite, Black Marble, Glass.
	- Normally when the tower is functioning properly, it provides lush comfort throughout it. Rooms are illuminated. Unseen Servants are bound to the tower itself. All fountains produce water on their own. The tower itself is almost like a magical creature, so far beyond the understanding of the Amythest Academy.
	- The doors and walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking magic.
	- Creatures can't teleport into or out of the tower rooms.
	- The topmost layer of the tower is the Nexus. It is a gigantic arcane aparatus, whirs clicks and hums on an Obsidian plinth. Lot of swirling magic stuff around it. Pulsing sphere of energy, which emits pulses of arcane plasma. This was not made by the Academy.
	- The deep cells below are almost impossibly deep, 1000 feet deep possibly. At the bottom of the pit is a permanent Sphere of Annihilation.
	- We take a small barge, courteous of Nox's patron to get into [[Drakkenheim]]. We occassionally see some creatures pulling our boat up the Drann.
