## Summary

## Event Log

- We probe past the [[Temple Gate]] looking for any other traces of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] that might be hanging around.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds some large hoof prints, perhaps a War Horse, possibly belonging to some scouts/members of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]].
- While attempting to short rest, a [[Hooded Lanterns]] patrol comes by, but we scare them off with a cloudkill spell.
- While attempting to rest again, we start hearing shambling coming down the walkway. Combat starts against three undead looking creatures.
- Elbows to hands, covered in green pustules, bubble to bubble, [[Silas]] emerges from the gas. We've beaten the creatures, but [[Silas]] stupidly decided to walk into the fucking stuff and got some gross stuff on himself.
- We continue searching for [[Knights of the Silver Order]] and stumble across a knight and a page on the road.
- [[Silas]] approaches them feigning that he needs help, with [[Sihrr]] following him with invisibility, and successfully uses Hold Person on the page, but not the knight. The knight draws his sword and charges at [[Silas]], but [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to take a shot but it glances off his armor. [[Sihrr]] attempts to use Telekinesis to rip away the knights sword. He succeeds in removing his sword, the Knight attempts to shield bash [[Silas]], but it splashed with a popping pustule.
