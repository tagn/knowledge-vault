## Summary

## Event Log

- We probe past the [[Temple Gate]] looking for any other traces of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] that might be hanging around.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds some large hoof prints, perhaps a War Horse, possibly belonging to some scouts/members of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]].
- While attempting to short rest, a [[Hooded Lanterns]] patrol comes by, but we scare them off with a cloudkill spell.
- While attempting to rest again, we start hearing shambling coming down the walkway. Combat!
-
