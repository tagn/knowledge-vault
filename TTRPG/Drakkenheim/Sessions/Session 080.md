## Summary

## Event Log

- We probe past the [[Temple Gate]] looking for any other traces of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] that might be hanging around.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds some large hoof prints, perhaps a War Horse, possibly belonging to some scouts/members of the [[Knights of the Silver Order]].
- While attempting to short rest, a [[Hooded Lanterns]] patrol comes by, but we scare them off with a cloudkill spell.
- While attempting to rest again, we start hearing shambling coming down the walkway. Combat starts against three undead looking creatures.
- Elbows to hands, covered in green pustules, bubble to bubble, [[Silas]] emerges from the gas. We've beaten the creatures, but [[Silas]] stupidly decided to walk into the fucking stuff and got some gross stuff on himself.
- We continue searching for [[Knights of the Silver Order]] and stumble across a knight and a page on the road.
- [[Silas]] approaches them feigning that he needs help, with [[Sihrr]] following him with invisibility, and successfully uses Hold Person on the page, but not the knight. The knight draws his sword and charges at [[Silas]], but [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to take a shot but it glances off his armor. [[Sihrr]] attempts to use Telekinesis to rip away the knights sword. He succeeds in removing his sword, the Knight attempts to shield bash [[Silas]], but it splashed with a popping pustule.
- We bind the Knight after he is infected, and convince the page that we're helpful. He says they have maybe half of their forces. We're not able to ascertain much more information out of the page. Once he seems to have outlived his usefulness, [[Silas]] beckons him closer and stabs him. We knock the knight unconscious and throw him on top of the horse.
- On our way to [[Buckle Down Row]], we approach the [[Drann River]] and come across a ferryman, that appears to be a haze husk, who approaches us and reaches his hand out. We give him a gold piece each and board his small boat, and he takes us across the river.
- We fail our next encounter check trying to make it back to [[Buckle Down Row]].
