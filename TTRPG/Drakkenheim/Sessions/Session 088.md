## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up going down the chute outside of the Kings chambers.
- We wind up in the Hall of Heroes, Keth notices a statue that kind of resembles Sihrr.
- Nox talks to some Gargoyles that are guarding the "Fountains of tears", they seem bored.
- The gargoyles saw the steward pass by towards the dungeons years ago.
- Keth looks around the statues more, and finds a hidden passage that leads into another hallway. She hears some clanging from down the hall, sounds like a kitchen.
- To the south-east there is the servants entrance. Through the kitchen we may find a sewer entrance.
- We fight some sludges, silas goes down. We enter the sewers with Nox protecting us with a neutralizing field.
- Nox's patron is known as the Dutchess, wants to bring more creatures through the rift.
- We level up back at the Cathedral, Elias Drexxel arrives asking to come with us.
- We enter into the Stewards office.
	- On his desk, is an unsent, unfinished letter. It is addressed to King Ulrich the 4th. It is a letter that reveals that the steward has found out about an illegitimate heir to House von Kessel - Robin aka Sihrr.
	- Should the bastard be removed from the picture or not?
- Can see straight across to the Royal apartments area, can't see into them over their battlements. We see Menazerand outside.
- We head way down the Stewards tower towards the basement.
