He supplies the potions, they supply protection, they didn't receive the latest batch. [[Ansom Lang]] wants us to go track him down. He resides in [[Reed Manor]]. Normally he would send an apprentice to the [[Shepard's Gate]] with a shipment. The week prior he only sent half of the normal order, some of the potions were contaminated. We're offered 250 gold and a weapon from their cache, a longsword or longbow with magical properties. He is "at odds" with the [[Amethyst Academy]]. They had an exclusive offer to deal with him.
