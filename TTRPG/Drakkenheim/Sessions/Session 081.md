## Summary

## Event Log

- The gang resumes in [[Buckle Down Row]]
- [[Silas]] forgot he had contamination and got another after sleeping.
- After we awake at the [[Clocktower]], the surrounding area appears to have returned to normal.
- We head over to the [[Inscrutable Tower]] and run into the [[Queen of Thieves]] waiting for us, accompanied by about 15 members of the [[Queen's Men]].
- We also see [[Lucretia]] accompanied by her planatars and some members of the [[Church of the Falling Fire]].
- We enter [[Inscrutable Tower]] and [[Lucretia]] seems jealous about how many earthly possessions the mages have.
- [[Sihrr]] begins the discussions between the group, stating that we wanted to broker the meeting of the ladies. He introduces [[Ryan Greymere]] as the arch-mage of [[Drakkenheim]].
- [[Sihrr]] reminds everyone that the two remaining factions, the [[Knights of the Silver Order]] and the [[Hooded Lanterns]] are both groups that want to remove the [[Delerium]] from the city.
- [[Ryan Greymere]] is not very concerned with a hostile takeover of the city.
- We're told that the [[Delerium]] alone is likely not the cause of the haze creatures itself, there seems to be a powerful presence that likely is in [[Castle Drakken]].
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] suggested about "cutting off the head" of the [[Hooded Lanterns]] and we noticed a negative reaction from the [[Queen of Thieves]].
- The [[Queen of Thieves]] informed [[Ryan Greymere]] that she will get in touch with the directorate, and advise them to send a representative to meet her.
- We request materials from the [[Inscrutable Tower]] that can aid us in burning a purple smoke.
