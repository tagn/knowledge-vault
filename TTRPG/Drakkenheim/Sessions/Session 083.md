## Summary

## Event Log

- We hear from someone in our bar, a year or two after this guy came to [[Drakkenheim]], a crew of his tried to break into the castle one evening. His friend made it back out of the castle and to [[Buckle Down Row]] before dying and told him a story about a very large minotaur in the castle that displayed unusual intelligence. It gored his friend multiple times and left him for dead.
	- We're not 100% sure if the guy was referring to some other creature that is similar to a minotaur.
- We rest up a bit while at our bar, then head towards [[Castle Drakken]] to scout out.
- [[Nox]] uses fly on our group to cross over the [[Drann River]] towards the smugglers tunnel located at the [[Black Ivory Inn]]
- We make our way through the smugglers tunnel. We enter into a large, wide cylindrical area, with a domed concrete ceiling. At the top, there appears to be a 5 foot opening leading up into Deep Haze.
	- This appears to be an old reservoir. Down in the water it's filled with dozens of water logged corpses.
	- Among the corpses we see a variety of folk, hooded lanterns, amethyst academy, queen's men, etc..
- We move into an area of the sewers, and encounter a group of "dregish" merfolk, accompanied by waterlogged women with sea weed for hair. 
- After originally telling us that there is no path through the sewers. They suddenly shift gears and offer to take us to a passage out. After a 30 or 40 minute walk, we reach the "exit" but there is no visible exit. One of the merladies pulls out a crab and smashes it against the wall, then smears it over the wall and a glamour on the wall disappears which reveals a staircase up into the city.
- We drop by the [[Klineburg Estate]], then head over to the library. On the way  there we do see a [[Hooded Lanterns]] patrol, perhaps 4 or 5 of them. [[Sihrr]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] want to assault them or something. [[Silas]] and [[Nox]] reluctantly follow. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] pounces on one of them and begins questioning them.
	- This kid we trapped doesn't know shit about the castle as we're questioning him.
