## Summary

## Event Log

- We hear from someone in our bar, a year or two after this guy came to [[Drakkenheim]], a crew of his tried to break into the castle one evening. His friend made it back out of the castle and to [[Buckle Down Row]] before dying and told him a story about a very large minotaur in the castle that displayed unusual intelligence. It gored his friend multiple times and left him for dead.
	- We're not 100% sure if the guy was referring to some other creature that is similar to a minotaur.
- We rest up a bit while at our bar, then head towards [[Castle Drakken]] to scout out.
- [[Nox]] uses fly on our group to cross over the [[Drann River]] towards the smugglers tunnel located at the [[Black Ivory Inn]]
- We make our way through the smugglers tunnel. We enter into a large, wide cylindrical area, with a domed concrete ceiling. At the top, there appears to be a 5 foot opening leading up into Deep Haze.
	- This appears to be an old reservoir. Down in the water it's filled with dozens of water logged corpses.
	- Among the corpses we see a variety of folk, hooded lanterns, amethyst academy, queen's men, etc..
