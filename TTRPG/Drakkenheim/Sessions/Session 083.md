## Summary

## Event Log

- We hear from someone in our bar, a year or two after this guy came to [[Drakkenheim]], a crew of his tried to break into the castle one evening. His friend made it back out of the castle and to [[Buckle Down Row]] before dying and told him a story about a very large minotaur in the castle that displayed unusual intelligence. It gored his friend multiple times and left him for dead.
	- We're not 100% sure if the guy was referring to some other creature that is similar to a minotaur.
