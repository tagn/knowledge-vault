## Summary

## Event Log

- We hear from someone in our bar, a year or two after this guy came to [[Drakkenheim]], a crew of his tried to break into the castle one evening. His friend made it back out of the castle and to [[Buckle Down Row]] before dying and told him a story about a very large minotaur in the castle that displayed unusual intelligence. It gored his friend multiple times and left him for dead.
	- We're not 100% sure if the guy was referring to some other creature that is similar to a minotaur.
- We rest up a bit while at our bar, then head towards [[Castle Drakken]] to scout out.
- [[Nox]] uses fly on our group to cross over the [[Drann River]] towards the smugglers tunnel located at the [[Black Ivory Inn]]
- We make our way through the smugglers tunnel. We enter into a large, wide cylindrical area, with a domed concrete ceiling. At the top, there appears to be a 5 foot opening leading up into Deep Haze.
	- This appears to be an old reservoir. Down in the water it's filled with dozens of water logged corpses.
	- Among the corpses we see a variety of folk, hooded lanterns, amethyst academy, queen's men, etc..
- We move into an area of the sewers, and encounter a group of "dregish" merfolk, accompanied by waterlogged women with sea weed for hair. 
- After originally telling us that there is no path through the sewers. They suddenly shift gears and offer to take us to a passage out. After a 30 or 40 minute walk, we reach the "exit" but there is no visible exit. One of the merladies pulls out a crab and smashes it against the wall, then smears it over the wall and a glamour on the wall disappears which reveals a staircase up into the city.
- We drop by the [[Klineburg Estate]], then head over to the library. On the way  there we do see a [[Hooded Lanterns]] patrol, perhaps 4 or 5 of them. [[Sihrr]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] want to assault them or something. [[Silas]] and [[Nox]] reluctantly follow. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] pounces on one of them and begins questioning them.
	- This kid we trapped doesn't know shit about the castle as we're questioning him.
- We arrive at the library, [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] looks for valuables, even though we've pilfered the place before.
- [[Sihrr]] finds an old religious tome that speaks of the old royal family was able to bind an old bronze dragon to serve as guardian of the castle. He is bound to the castle and does not speak. It has not been used to defend the place before.
- [[Silas]] finds a general history of the city of [[Drakkenheim]], containing quotes from famous dignitaries or notable people. It has some very general information about the castle, but not anything super specific. This castle is a little over 500 years old and was originally a manor for House von Drakken, that over time grew into the castle itself. Over generations it shifted to other noble lines. About 150 years ago, House von Kessel took over and started expanding the castle quite a bit. It is a much more lavish palace than it once way. [[Castle Drakken]] itself for the last 150 years has been the seat of the monarchy here. There are a few mentions of the throne room via peoples personal impressions of it. There is a central keep in the Castle where the grand chambers are contained. There is a huge, broad entrance opening into the Great Hall. House von Kessels crest is a dragon on a green field. There is a long corridor called the Hall of Heroes that leads towards the Throne Room. The Throne room itself is a centerpiece of the castle, it's a vast chamber, ringed by balconies. There is a Royal Chapel attached to the keep. Just past the main gate itself is a large outer courtyard, where people would pass through. The soldiers would often drill there.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds a children's story about a wishing crown that he was given three wishes, and had used two of them, saving the third for a rainy day. The crown in the children's book seems pretty similar in appearance to the actual crown of the royal family.
- We head up the path towards [[Castle Drakken]] to scope out the area. The castle sits on a 200ft high cliff above the city. As we approach from the lower gate, we see ahead of us a pair of bastion towers, a portcullis, and a draw bridge. This gate rests just as the base of the cliff. We hear some gross shambling noises. There appears to be a mass of peasants/commonfolk that tried to get in after the meteor hit. It seems to have melded together in a pile of flesh up against the gate.
- [[Sihrr]] summons his draconic spirit, but as soon as he does the haze around the castle corrupts it in some way. It doesn't appear like its friendly to us. Something else might be taking control of it.
- [[Silas]] is torn on what happened with the summoned dragon.
	- 1. Something corrupts things draconic.
	- 2. Something about the area tries to take over summons.
- The gate/etc.. has Armor of Agathas on it. It seems like it's completely magically reinforced. They are immune to fire, poison, psychic damage, resistant to all other damage. It completely extends into the ethereal plane. Creatures outside of any castle structure cannot teleport into the interior of any other castle structure. A character attuned to a seal of drakkenheim ignores this effect.
