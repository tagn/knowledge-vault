## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up after the bridge gauntlet. There is nothing of particular interest on the corpses.
- We head back to the clocktower before heading back out.
- We speculate on the idea of sneaking through the [[Garmyr]], but don't really decide on anything
- After a long rest, we head down towards the Champion's Gate to get back towards [[Emberwood Village]].
	- In the South Ward, very few structures are standing. There is a thick fog of the deep [[Haze]] blanketing the area.
	- There is some stone, brick, and timber that is facing the crater and appears melted.
	- There is a acrid/pungent smell in the air, as if a weird material was burning nearby.
	- Every so often we hear crumbling rock or some remnants of structures that are collapsing.
- We arrive over at the [[Champion's Gate]].
- [[Silas]] disguises himself as a Hooded Lantern soldier and slips into their ranks.
	- He seems a discussion happening between the leader of the [[Hooded Lanterns]]
	- The doors of the [[Red Lion Inn]] open up, an old man we haven't seen before walks out, trailed by [[River (AA)]] and her automaton bodyguard.
	- He waits with the formation of soldiers to try to gather some information.
- The Queen beckons her Champion's into the circle.
- The Lord of the Feast is a Garmyr
	- Incredibly large
	- Albino
	- Well armed, has been known to shoot a longbow taller than a soldier. It has enough force to put down a knight in plate armor in one shot.
- We meet up with Eilas Drexel at the [[Watchtower]].
- We head to the Silver Order camp to ask about getting supplies for the assault on the city.
