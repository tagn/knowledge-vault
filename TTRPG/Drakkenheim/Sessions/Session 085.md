## Summary

Until sliding poles were invented in the 1870s, why did us fire stations prefer to use spiral staircases instead of regular ones.

In Oregon City USA, graveyard contains Glenn and Marie Pendergraph with a shared grave. The headstone states Glenn died in 1965, but Marie's year of death contains 6 characters, why?

## Event Log

- We have 2 of the 4 seals that we need, and discuss the possibilities to get the remaining.
	- The staff - Unlikely, Ryan Greymere has it
	- The lord commanders seal - Would need to talk to Elias Drexxel
	- The chancellors crest - The queen is going to give it back to us
	- The spymasters signet - Unsure, best guess is that the queen has it
	- The crown - Unknown, probably in the castle
- We asked the Queen about the spymasters signet, she said she looked for it for years.
- The spymaster was a half-elf assassin - turns out the queen killed her and got the ring from her.
- There are many denizens inside the tower that won't respect them. Chief amongst them, menezerad.
- We make back for our tower.
- Nox has some vision about a rift next to the throne, a large scary creature, and a crown.
