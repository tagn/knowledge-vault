## Summary

## Event Log

- We seem to be able to see about a mile from the clocktower now. The [[Haze]] seems gone.
- Walking down the clocktower, everything seems to be as it was before.
- The courtyard to the clocktower is restored upon going outside.
- Everything outside seems to be actually restored, and intact.
- The facade of the demonic temple appears to be adorned with infernal sigils, the surface etched with torment and torture, twisted pictures of writhing and agony. Above the door is a bust of some creature.
	- The visage seen above the door is very recognizable, the lord of hell, azmodeus.
- We chase [[Sihrr]] towards his family home, the city
- We step inside the temple, with [[Silas]] using daylight with his necklace.
- The walls inside are all stone, covered with Grotesque murals, depicting cycles of suffering and damnation.
- The only thing that breaks the silence is a dripping sound in the distance.
- Murmurs of spell incantations or curses seem to come from the floor.
- It smells like death. We can't see around corners well with the light. Something isn't right here. This is profane.
- We come across a throne that seems to be crafted for a great devil, that corrupts the air around them.
- Lounging on the throne, is a creature with the head of a panther, resting on top of an 8 foot tall humanoid body.
	- The hand raised towards us is backwards.
	- A Rakshasa, typically has a defect in its natural form. The reversed palms are distinctive.
