## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick up right after just having finished our last arena battle, then put our hat in the ring for a battle against the champion. Both our group
- The [[Queen of Thieves]] is on the other side of the arena talking to a few people, including [[Blackjack Mel]].
- While we discuss our plans, there are people stopping by and saluting us, giving us props, etc..
- Some lady with long grey hair bought some of the Aqua [[Delerium]].
- [[Sihrr]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] go over to buy potions and supplies from [[Tig]] before we go meet our death to the champion. [[Tig]] asks to buy our shit.
- We purchase 2 healing potions and a potion of water breathing in exchange for one of the [[Keth's Krew]] pins.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Seven]] approach the [[Queen of Thieves]] surrounded by a lot of the major gang leaders.
	- They get some updates about the rules.
	- [[Sihrr]] and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] meet back up with us. 
- The other group are in the [[Catacomb Cobras]].
- [[Seven]] and [[Sihrr]] join up with the Rose and Thorns.
- We chat up the other group, they seem like physical combatants. They seem to be young and cocky. One appears heavily armored, one hulking dude, and a younger girl, dressed similarly to [[Keth Darklighter]].
- [[Blackjack Mel]] comes over and pulls sacks out of a box. We're all blindfolded and taken over to another arena.
- 20-30 minutes of walking we arrive inside of what seems to be an old natural water reservoir.
	- The [[Queen of Thieves]] is up on a balcony to watch the fight.
	- [[Blackjack Mel]] is standing up on the edge of the pit.
	- We're about 40 feet down in this pit arena.
- Nobody leaves until the fight is over. The balcony is off limits. Anything else we want to do is fine.
- We position ourselves for a fight. The [[Queen of Thieves]] blows a silent whistle and immediately after we hear a loud stomping sound.
- [[Big Linda]] appears to be a large scaly, kind of looks like a T-Rex. Fight starts!
	- Her mouth glows green and she breaths acid on the other group, doing 11d8 of damage. Good fucking lord.
	- On the second round, four Kobolds join the fray.
	- [[Seven]] gets TWO nat 20's on his first set of attacks against [[Big Linda]]
	- We continue to smash the thing with crits and take it down.
	- We clean up the other group.
- Before the [[Queen of Thieves]] addresses us, she revives [[Big Linda]] and it walks back off passively back to where it came from.
- She tells our group that she is impressed. We follow the queen to somewhere more comfortable, through a kitchen, through what appears to be a [[Velkynvelve]].
- The Queen changes her guise, reverting? back to look like an older Elf.
- We ask for the debt to be forgiven, the Queen says they can take care of it.
- [[Blackjack Mel]] enters the room with the three Drow bound up.
- The queen approaches the Drow, whispers something to each of them, and they each just go still. She instructs them that [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] DID throw the fight as they asked, and paid the remainder of the debt in full.
- She requests that we do her a favor by going into the city and retrieve something from the [[Pale Man]].
	- Get him to divulge the information
	- Get his writings or research
	- She marks on our map the [[Klineburg Estate]]
	- She'll give us all the information about the "box" we delivered if we're able to get his research. She wants the ability to reverse a monstrous transformation.
	- It's possible we might be able to take the smugglers tunnel through to get to where the [[Pale Man]] resides.
- She also requests from us:
	- A few members are imprisoned inside of the [[Hooded Lanterns]] garrison.
	- She would pay greatly if we would free them from their cells.
- It is revealed that she was in the Garrison during the execution of [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]].
- The [[Queen of Thieves]] pulls out a set of pins for us. They each depict different suits of the Queen. These should give us respect from the [[Queen's Men]]. 
	- If we need to reach the [[Queen of Thieves]], once a day, we can tap the pin and send her a message.
- [[Blackjack Mel]] leads us back to [[Buckle Down Row]].
- We speak with [[Rose Carver]]. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] goes and pays 200 gold into the well as her tithe.
- We make it back to [[Emberwood Village]] safely.
- [[Sihrr]] tells us about his old mentor guy, "Sir Justin", that he is trying to find.
- We return to the house, nailed to the door is an envelope.
	- Whispers echo, tales grow tall, But heed this warning, lest you fall. The stories told, the tales you've heard, Might not reflect the truth, word for word. Veiled in mist, I lurk unseen, But not all is as it's always been. Challenge your thoughts, donâ€™t be so sure, For in the unknown, the truth is obscure
