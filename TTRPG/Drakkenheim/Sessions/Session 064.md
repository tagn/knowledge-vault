## Event Log

- Contact other plane questions:
	- Will the confrontation with the one I previously referred to as my grandmother result in violence? possibly
	- In exchange for my service, with the condition that my friends are off limits, will you bless me with the strength to fight? no
	- Are you able to provide safe passage to return from the fey wilds, back to [[Drakkenheim]] in the material plane? possibly
	- Do you know of [[Lucritia]], leader of the [[Church of the Falling Fire]]? no
	- Will following [[Lucritia]] bring ruin to my companions? yes
- [[Silas]] tells the group about his collect call, then a bit of the backtory with his Grandmother.
- [[Silas]] gains a [[Contamination]] level during his sleep
- [[Sihrr]] uses his scroll of scrying on grannie. The orb appears in a corner of a "cozy" cottage.
	- Grannie is sitting with a bell in her hand, in-front of a table. On the table is a map of [[Drakkenheim]].
	- On the map, there is an X on the map with the Kleinburg Estate.
	- There is another X where [[Oscar Yorn]] was.
	- There are a bunch of circles drawn around the Cathedral.
	- Grannie rings her bell, and someone that could pass as a younger brother of [[Silas]] enters the room. She slaps him because he was too slow.
	- She writes something on paper, then looks up at the scrying orb and pulls it in.
- We awaken and proceed to have breakfast at the inn.
- We approach the front desk and inquire about how to return to the Fey Wilds.
- The innkeeper hands us a business card that she can reach us through on if she has found a way for us to return home.
- We leave town, going towards grannies house. We arrive at a cliff with a steep drop of about 800 feet and find our way down.
- We take camp for the evening at the base. Everyone has shitty dreams. [[Sihrr]] and [[Keth Darklighter]] lose some "Sanity". [[Silas]] does not. [[Arken Highbloom]] dreams of a fucking demon entering the Cathedral, killing [[Lucritia]], the demon looks like [[Milando]].
- [[Silas]] gains a [[Contamination]] level during his sleep..again.
- We are at a large expanse called the Frostveil Sea. We encounter a Giant that [[Silas]] attempts to sweet talk unsuccessfully because he can't speak Giant.
- We defeat the giant and put it to rest.
- We encounter a 200 foot long fucking bird. [[Silas]] banishes it and we run the fuck away.
- At some point in the past [[Silas]] talking to his grandmother, there was a conversation regarding the "gateway staircase" which acts somehow as a shortcut. 
- We continue across the bridge.
- [[Sihrr]] purges the [[Contamination]] from [[Silas]] gaining him 3 levels of exhaustion.
- [[Silas]] drops a level of sanity after a bad dream, now down to 4.
- We give trolls some magical food on the bridge.
- We find a cone-shaped gap cut in the bridge and have to figure out how to cross it.
- We end up heading down the stairs, and are no longer over the frozen ocean, but now in a clear boreal forest, with small crystals coming out of the ground.
- We start to see some nice and weird wildlife.
- A bird makes a C flat sound another one responds in a B sharp? Idk what that shit even means.
- We feel unusually safe taking a rest in this forest.
- We awaken to an elven woman, preparing a stew who tells us to be calm.
- Lady Frostgleam, the caretaker of the forest. Wake and eat, build our strength.
- She is unable to offer us any assistance, but will guide us in the correct direction.
- We should come up with some questions to ask Lady Frostgleam during our travel to grannies house.
