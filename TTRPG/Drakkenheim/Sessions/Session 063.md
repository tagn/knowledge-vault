## Summary

## Event Log

- We head over to the Rose Theatre to see if Ryan can assist us getting to the fey wilds.
- Ryan Greymere gave us some information, but was unable to help us get to the Fey Wilds.
- We likely need to talk to the [[Amethyst Academy]] directly

- We convince Eldritch Runeweaver to transport us to the fey wilds.
- [[Silas]] strips naked and the gate to the city lets him in. [[Sihrr]] and [[Keth Darklighter]] both give the gate a nice compliment. [[Arken Highbloom]] runs into the gate and it hits him, then he lays on the ground and is allowed in.
- An ice elemental slides out in front of us and turns itself into a shape of a wall. 
- We're instructed by the frost elemental to make our way to the lodge prior to going anywhere else since we're mostly from the material plane and they aren't super fond of them.
