## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We take a short rest in a not great location, but we're safe
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] identifies his items and attunes to the spider
- We come up to the river
	- Smells sickly and sour
	- Water level is about 4 feet below the sea wall
- Across the river, looks like the city was leveled by a tornado for the most part. Some buildings seem to be standing well. There is a low, wafting steam floating above the water.
- [[Arken Highbloom]] notices a "river pourpice fin" crest the water
- We scout for any sort of dock/marina/boats/etc..
- A rope is still in place, attached to the rope is 
- [[Arken Highbloom]] replaces the rope and tests it out, seems like it might hold some people to cross
- We discuss maybe reinforcing the "raft" to use it to cross
- We walk further up the riverwalk, keth finds a box on a table, looks to be filled with business cards
	- Amandas Outdoor something - "Your Adventure Our Pleasure"

- We continue to walk, but [[Sihrr]] looks through the cards for things he knows about
- We fail our encounter check on the way out, following the river up out of [[Drakkenheim]]
- We reach a park nearly out of the city, [[Keth Darklighter]] is nearly grabbed by a dive bombing manticore
- Water looks a little better up river, but not great, we likely can't just dodge it by going far around it
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] tries to buy some ammo for the weapon, [[Armin Gainsbury]] doesnt have any leads, [[Lyrian]] from the gentlemen bastards comes by and notices and tries to help but he scares her off. He'll need to find her later to sort out some ammo
- [[Sihrr]] goes to [[Aldor the Immense]] to look at buying some magic items
- We try to buy some empty barrels from [[Karen]]
- We make our way to the city to get back to the river
- We fail encounter check on the way in, then find a sloped road that looks sunken
- We hear an "elephant roar" then get a telepathic message about bodies getting crunched by teeth
