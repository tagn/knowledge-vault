## Event Log

- [[Keth Darklighter]] kills a bird.
- We have a letter nailed to our board about some "Black Iron" people that are new in town.
- We start discussing the Clock Tower.
- Allegedly, [[Sihrr]] knows about some dragon potentially buried beneath the city, named [[Argonath]].
	- He knows this dragon is great friend of a paladin.
	- This dragon has been dead about 500 years.
	- He's well know by the [[Knights of the Silver Order]]
	- During his life, he was a loyal defender of the city of [[Drakkenheim]].
	- It is rumored his body is buried beneath some building within the city.
	- Resurrecting him may have some great outcome.
	- This was the gold dragon who fought beside [[Saint Vitruvio]].
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] goes out and finds us a cat.
- The rest of the gang goes to look for the [[Gentlemen Bastards]] to get some information about the Clock Tower.
- We head to the [[Bark & Buzzard]] and chat with Karen.
- We don't find the [[Gentlemen Bastards]], so we explore some other ideas about where we can go for information.
- The tower rests in the middle of [[Market Square Plaza]].
- We finish up breakfast, chat for a bit about who to go talk to, then go out to find [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]].
- We talk to [[Balthazar Adamos]] about the Clock Tower.
	- It sits in the center of [[Market Square Plaza]]
	- The area is quite open, used to be an open air market.
	- Lot of the area now is destroyed.
	- Primary source of time in the city before it broke down.
	- It stopped working many years before the city was destroyed.
	- The [[Amethyst Academy]] kept the tower running through non clockwork means
- The item we're searching for is a necklace with a seal on it. It has an image of a dragon flying over the walls of what appears to be the city of [[Drakkenheim]].

- [[Silas]] drags [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] reluctantly into the [[Skull & Sword]] after being insulted by the boy on a soapbox in the middle of town with a bunch of ignorant remarks.
- [[Silas]] gets yelled at when entering the bar by the stupid ass skull.
- We have some racists try to start shit with us, we step out before something escalates.
- The group gets back together. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] tries to fuck with the new magic shop. [[Sihrr]] goes to listen to the kid yelling stupid stories in the middle of town.
- [[Sihrr]] fucks up the kids sandwich. The kid surprisingly, also hates snakes.
- We walk back to the [[Skull & Sword]], [[Silas]] disguises himself as a human princess similar to one the town crier had described before entering.
- After getting into a confrontation with the Black Iron group, we notice the severed head of [[Oscar Yorn]].
- Before a fight starts, [[Sihrr]] warps both [[Silas]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] out of the bar.
