## Summary

## Event Log

- We pick back up in the scriptorium.
	- The south of the room has a statue with an aperture device
	- The west side of the room has another aperture door, but the light does not extend far enough to reach it
- We go back down to the room to the south, and redirect the lights to open another door
- We enter a room with a statue of some paladin in the center
	- Saint Vitruvio
	- Cavities in the statue at the right thigh hold the remaining bones of Saint Vitruvio
	- Hundreds of lit candles
	- A mirror shield is affixed on the wall to the south.

	- The shield on the south wall was easily removed, revealing another aperture. [[Keth Darklighter]] attempts to light it by reflecting the beam but nothing happens.
- We take three of the shields up with us, leaving the remaining shield inside of the sealed crypt.
- We go down the left stairway into the catacombs.
- [[Arken Highbloom]] angles the statue towards the path, revealing another burial chamber. We angle another beam above an empty grave site and it opens another room.
	- [[Keth Darklighter]] loots a few spell scrolls, we also find another shield.
- To the north, is a room with a large marble fountain, with a tragic looking statue. The statue depicts an angelic man looking up towards the heavens. Hands rest an inch above the fountain
	- Above the fountain are four evenly spaced iron handles.
- To the south, we find what appears to be another tomb. All of the candles have gone out. On one of the tombs is a shining shield.
	- All of the mummies in the room arise as we enter.
- Blood Elemental HP =>
	- 64 - 6 - 6 = 52
	- 52 - 22 = 30
	- 30 - 7 = 23 - 12 = 11 - 4 - 5 = 2
	- Ded
- In the north-east alcove there are two statues, facing each other, holding non-mirrored kite shields. There is a large stone plaque polished to a mirrored sheen between them.
	- Lighting up an aperture above them reveals a ~60 foot tall tunnel
	- [[Keth Darklighter]] and [[Sihrr]] head upwards into what appears to be the vault
	- [[Keth Darklighter]] finds and stashes something that seems to be the lineage for the Royal family.
	- [[Sihrr]] takes some "shit marked with Celestial ruins from a chest in a room that we were explicitly asked to not look through". He takes vials of blood, after taking the fourth vial it glows and other runes appear.
	- We betray ourselves and the [[Hooded Lanterns]] by doing exactly what they asked us not to do, by stealing everything from the room, then [[Sihrr]] sealed the room shut with Stone Shape to hide it.
- In the room to the north, there is a blade surrounded by flame floating.
- [[Arken Highbloom]] touches the sword, gets more or less told that he is unworthy, gets kicked back, and a "Deva" appears in place.
- [[Silas]] pulls [[Arken Highbloom]] out, while [[Sihrr]] gets downed, then revived by the sword.
- We return to the surface, and find a gathering of the leaders of the various factions having a meeting.
- Lucretia declares that the Cathedral would be safe refuge for the Sacred Flame, which causes a disagreement with the leader of the Silver Order.
- We somehow successfully lie to Elias Drexel about not finding the chamber containing the royal family artifacts.
- We hand over the phylactery to Lucretia. She uses detect magic on it, then casts legend lore on it.
- She reveals something isn't right with the item. Pulls [[Arken Highbloom]] aside, asks if companions are trustworthy, then says she will
