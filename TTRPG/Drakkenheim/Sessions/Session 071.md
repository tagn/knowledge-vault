## Event Log

- We rest in the Cathedral, then return to see Ryan Greymere at the Rose Theatre.
- As we're arriving, we watch an incredibly large mansion blink out of space inside of the dome.
- We venture over to the Inscrutable tower, taking note that there should be a teleportation circle inscribed in front of the tower.
- We kill the shit in front of the Tower, while [[Silas]] inscribes the teleportation sigils into his notebook.
	- The front door leads into a massive lobby, supported by Obsidian pillars. The floor is reflective marble decorated with arcane patterns. Long thin vents allow a view of [[Drakkenheim]] outside. 
	- There are three sets of double doors, and spiral staircases in the corners.
	- Dividers in the area provide small semi-private meeting areas.
- We are ambushed by some shield guardians as soon as we enter the tower.
- We go up the upper right stairs and enter into a mess room.
- Lobby, Great Hall, Residences, Research Floors.

- Various tools, weapons, workbenches. We open a door into the room to the north and there is a pedestal
- We find four ingots of metal we haven't seen before.
	- 2 bars of each type of metal. One cold
	- We find what we're pretty certain are golem amulets/golem hearts.
		- Three amulets, one of which lights up, significantly more charged.
		- [[Silas]] touches some shit he shouldn't, activates a golem, uses dispel magic on the glowing amulet and deactivates the golem.
- We stop at the spell forge, that looks cool. [[Sihrr]] hits a button to take us to the Alchemy Lab.
- We smell the reek of various chemicals.
- We spend over an hour searching the Alchemy room.
	- Any spell component that is needed for a level 6 or below spell can be found here.
	- A phoenix feather, seems valuable.
	- A jar of some sort of magical sand in an hourglass. The sand seems to be magical.
	- A salve in a jar, looks like its made of some black wood, mixed with oil and blood. Hard to tell what it does.

		- Blood clots in it (red)
		- Foul-smelling purple/gray, little bit of gray matter left in it
		- Cerulean blue
		- Smells like Sandalwood and Jasmine
