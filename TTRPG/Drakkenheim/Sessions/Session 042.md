## Summary

## Event Log

- We awake to a phone call from the [[Queen of Thieves]]
- We say we'll meet her around noon tomorrow at the smugglers tunnel.
- We take a peek up at the roof of the Clocktower
- We talk about going to the bridge to the south, then go up towards the [[Klineburg Estate]].
- We make our way towards the bridge.
- [[Keth Darklighter]] fires off a arrow with an eerie token attached to it.
	- Horrible corpse wrapped in some cloth
	- A few skeletons shambling about
	- Undead looking beholder
	- Bridge did not seem to be broken significantly
- We decide that it's best to not try to take the fight on the bridge
- We make our way towards the [[Klineburg Estate]] and encounter a few [[Haze]] husks and wights.
- We get a bit lost, then end up near Slaughterstone square. We hear loud stomping and take cover (poorly). A 20-25 foot tall metallic construct appears ahead of us, wielding what appears to be an entire guillotine.
