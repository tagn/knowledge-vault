## Summary

## Event Log

- We do some shopping and buy two greater healing potions and two regular healing potions.
- [[Keth Darklighter]] gets a tip about the hazewalker plate being quite valuable.
- We discuss some plans with the iron banshee, but probably will end up winging it.
- The temple gate seems more fortified since the last time we had been there.
- We're allowed passage through the gate.
- The rose theater is the "magic dome place". 
- We talk to a super useful guard who had "bumped into" the dome, but knocked and nobody was home.
- [[Keth Darklighter]] introduces us to the Iron Bitch by attempting to dig under it with a shovel. She's super stoked about it.
- [[Keth Darklighter]] admits that we're sent by [[Milando]] to try to get the armor from her.
- She made the armor herself. She believes it is the only set of it.
- [[Silas]] suggests it might be easier if we just let [[Milando]] kill [[Keth Darklighter]] and then maybe we can revive her.
- [[Silas]] suggests maybe having Grandmother talk [[Milando]] into killing himself.
- We head over and talk to Gramps about the situation. He seemed equally as apprehensive about a meeting with Ryan Greymere.
- [[Sihrr]] mentioned the Frederick Von Lichten name to grandfather and he freaked out and ran inside.
