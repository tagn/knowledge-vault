## Summary

## Event Log

- Without Ryan Greymere at the Rose Theatre, the barrier will fail. She has requested we retrieve the [[Delerium]] Geode
- We ask about the spells, as well as the components to fix the clocktower. She'll get back to us on these. Perhaps returning in a day to use the spell forge.
- We're asked to not speak about the Nexus to others.
