## Summary

## Event Log

- We somehow lost our way back as it was getting dark and end up in a cemetery.
- Turns out we have a combat with a bunch of fucking undead, including bears, and some mimic gravestones.
- We find out [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] had a job go south, had to dump her cargo into apparently a volcano. She is now 10,000 gold in debt to a previous employer.
- We consider the possibility that her previous employer may have thought that she told the gold, so she really wants to be able to repay the employer and is scrounging up her gold.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] believes our job to deliver the package went off without a hitch.
- We head to the [[Hendricks Farm]] to try to give over the [[Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio]]. The guard here sucks and won't go get Nathaniel because he needs his beauty rest.
- [[Nathaniel]] confirms the identity of the staff. He wants us to bring this staff straight to [[Lucretia]] herself at the [[Saint Selina's Monastery]]
- We go into a barn to sleep for the night at the [[Hendricks Farm]].
- All of the people sleeping in the barn give us a knee and part way for us to head to the loft to sleep.
- We get a long rest, which makes it... 3? more days until my spider comes back.
- We awaken to a guard of like 70 people just waiting for us at the bottom of the barn.
- We're given some instruction by Nathaniel of where we need to go to get to [[Champion's Gate]]
- He explains the area we're going into is "thicker, more malicious, and dangerous" than what we've experienced thus far. The people near the monastery are protected from the [[Haze]], but we should not linger long.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] requests to [[Nathaniel]] for him to inform [[Flamekeeper Hannah]] that we retrieved the staff.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] hands [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] a pouch of 300 gold to buy supplies while he's in town.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] makes it to the caravan court when a group of [[Hooded Lanterns]] ride up with [[Ansom Lang]] and detain [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]], take his belongings, and dump his ass inside of a cell.
- [[Keth Darklighter]] and [[Sihrr]] head and check out the house we stay in within [[Emberwood Village|Emberwood]], and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] finds her bed had shifted. Her stash in the wall seems to have been touched but nothing was taken.
- [[Armin Gainsbury]] waves down [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Sihrr]] and informs them that [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] was arrested at spear point by the [[Hooded Lanterns]].
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] and [[Sihrr]] don't seem to be getting any extra attention from the [[Hooded Lanterns]]. They head to the [[Chapel of Saint Ardenna]] to see if they can get a message sent out to the [[Hendricks Farm]] to go inform [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] about [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]]'s situation.
- We jump back to [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] who has been locked in a cell for 15-20 minutes. There are a few other people in the cells. A few cells contain ruffian looking fellas, one contains a [[Hooded Lanterns]], 
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] asks for some advice from the other prisoners for advice on his [[Velkynvelve]] stay.
- [[Sihrr]] attempts to figure out what happened with [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] and the guards inform him by the order of [[Ansom Lang]] he is not permitted entrance to the [[Watchtower]]. 
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] apparently didn't protect the people from the box well enough, Frank and Vinnie perished in the fallout. Apparently they came back and had to be put down a second time.
- [[Sihrr]] is told to kindly go fuck off, and is refused any sort of audience. He sits down on a rock outside of the [[Watchtower]] and tells the guards he'll wait until [[Ansom Lang]] comes to see him.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] goes and explains the situation to [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]], and [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] reveals to him about [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] putting a message on the box.
- The two ruffians in the cell next to me get removed and put into a cell further away.
- Stretchers with three dead [[Hooded Lanterns]] are placed and unveiled in the cell next to him.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] is told by [[Ansom Lang]] that he's going to get fucked if he doesn't be truthful/etc.. with them.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Will]] wants to ask them like, "Why did you open the box!"
