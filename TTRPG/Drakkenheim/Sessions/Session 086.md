## Summary

## Event Log

- We start making our way up the road towards the second gate. Inside we see two large humanoid statues on the gate. There are a pair of bastion towers, portcullis, no draw bridge.
- The moment the portcullis starts opening, we hear a rumbling around us. We watch as the statues come to life and attack us.
- We walk another 400-500 feet towards the main castle gates.
- Nox uses the Chancellor’s crest and is able to open the gate.
- The haze is real bad inside the Castle. There are flakes of delirium in the air. Growing up the walls like a cancer are what appears to be delerium moss. Inside the blobs of delirium sludge there are mouths and eyes forming and informing at random.
    - We’re in the Bailey?
    - We see a T shaped brick road.
    - The road straight ahead curves and goes somewhere. The left and right follow the walls of the castle on the inside. There are buildings to the left and right. We can’t see ahead.
    - We continue straight down the road, in the hopes going directly towards the castle.
    - We skip exploring the exterior castle grounds, and run into a portcullis.
- We climb the next portcullis into the castle proper.
- Silas leaves the Rope of Climbing tied up with knots incase we might need to make a quick escape out of the castle. 
- We appear to now be in the castle gardens.
- Descending upon us is a Balor, which is a fiend from hell. *yay*
- They normally wield a flaming whip and a longsword.
- They are *roughly* as strong of a demon outside of a demon prince as you will find.
- The creature is covered in lacerations, potentially driven insane.
- He is the “prince of carnage”, we have invaded his territory, and he is going to eat our souls.
- We almost get killed by a balor in the castle courtyard.
- While attempting to rest, a band of bearded brothers comes to ask to borrow a cup of sugar.
- We successfully rest on the second attempt.
- We emerge from the guardhouse after the rest.
- We make our way to the Chapel, which seems filled with gibbering mothers and shit. We kill them all easily over 10 minutes.
- We gas the mass of gibbering mouthers, and take pot shots.
- We find a note from Johan Isner - Dear flame keeper veressa, apologies of the delays. The king is keeping the shield over the mantle. We also find an altar box next to the altar. We hear the shattering of glass inside the box.
    - We find two potions of superior healing, greater restoration, raise dead.
    - Heal scroll.
- We exit the Chapel, and see the Castle.
- Four great round towers surround the castle. The outer walls have overhanging balconies and tall arched windows. There are gargoyles and dragons on the top. There are four gates. Beams of sickly purple light radiant from within the castle. Thunder crackles through the air.
- When we leave the Chapel, we hear and feel in the air that a very very large creature is above us that appears to be moving in our direction.
- We narrowly escape the dragons breath as it sweeps across the front of the castle, by presenting our seals to the front entrance and diving inside.
- Silas disguises himself as some sort of high flame keeper to maybe confuse some cracked out fucker in the cathedral.
- We’re attacked by a bunch of Haze wights as we walk into the castle.
- All of the rooms are themed around a different mythological pantheons.
- As we walk through the castle, we see a lot of the portraits of the royal families.
- Ceilings are vaulted, around 30 feet high. The artwork on the walls are massive painted murals, lifelike statues on the pedestals.
- We walk down the hallway, opening the first door to the left, it seems to be a dining hall of sorts.
- Not opens the door to the grand ballroom, it’s fucking filled with shit.
    - It’s filled with multiple hundred ghosts playing out some last ball.
- The throne room would likely be straight ahead. We’ll likely hit the antechamber, and the throne room continuing the direct path.
- There are golden double doors above and below the balcony landings?
- Something conjures a wall of force, blocking the direction to the throne room. We hear some male laughter.
- Up the stairs to the left, it seems like it may go up another 100 feet.
- We head over and go up the right side instead.
- From the bottom of the tower thing we see some bright chandelier.
- At the first landing going up, we seem some arched ridgeway
