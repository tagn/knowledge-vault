## Summary

## Event Log

- [[Keth Darklighter]] is rolled up dead in a bag. Woot!
- We arrive at the cathedral, there is a sermon being given by Lucretia.
- Lucretia lies to us for some reason about using resurrection.
- We give her some shit about not helping us.
- We ask the Queen, she refers us to Lucretia or the druid to the north.
- Ryan Greymere is unable to assist us, we continue north and hop the wall towards the north.
- We find five stones, surrounding a stone altar, which appears to be permanently stained with blood. There is a barrow mound, which somewhat looks like a hobbit home.
- This appears to be a druid whom residing at a shrine of the "Phantom Queen". The shrine of morrigan. It is a shadowy old god, whos domains are of war and trickery, whom holds power over life and death.
- We approach the home, and the door opens and out comes a very old looking elf.
- In exchange for [[Keth Darklighter]]'s life, we have need to provide the druid with a humanoid of equal standing to [[Keth Darklighter]], along with a diamond worth about 1000g, and an offering to the druid.
- We purchase a scroll of resurrection to use on [[Keth Darklighter]] from Vil in exchange for the legendary stone thing that [[Keth Darklighter]] has.
- We successfully revive [[Keth Darklighter]], then go to [[Hendricks Farm]] for the evening to rest.
