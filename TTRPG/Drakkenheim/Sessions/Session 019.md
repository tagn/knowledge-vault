## Summary

## Event Log

- We make our way over to the [[Red Lion Hotel]] to try to catch up with the [[Ironhelms]].
- There appears to be a few dwarves, surrounded by a few others that seem to be guarding them
- We grab a table close to the dwarves to ease drop a bit before we try to talk to them.
- We request a corking service because we brought our own wine. The server obliges and brings us some food to go with the wine.
- One dwarf is in a black cloak with a trench coat, I see a few daggers, he has a long scar across his face and a long goatee that goes to his belt buckle.
- Another dwarf is wearing common grey robes, thick leather straps and a breastplate on top. Some sort of mechanical trinket. Long brown hair. Lots of tools and instruments.
- [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] is on the night shift at [[The Smithy]]. They come and go to and from [[The Smithy]].
- The female dwarf is not Gertrude, but she offered and cast a healing spell on [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] to heal and cleanse her. Her name is [[Eloise]].
- We ask to accompany them into town when they head back to [[The Smithy]].
- They say we can go with them after a shift change around noon the following day. They have a shift change at the [[Red Lion Hotel]] at noon.
- [[Eloise]] has a brother named [[Mordecai]]. 
- [[Sihrr]] pays our tab of 10 gold and we head back home.
- We find a box waiting in front of our house. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] tries to pop it open and it won't open. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] detects magic on it and gets some abjuration, with some kind of necromancy inside.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] decides that if we're going to go through with delivery of this package of the [[Queen's Men]], he's going to do his best to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone. 
- We take a long rest.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] heard a few rumors, such as a dragon being located deep below the city, the gargoyles on the walls will come to life and attack you if you try to scale the walls. The [[Velkynvelve]] cells in the city may be shielded enough from the [[Haze]] to rest.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] procures reagents to cast Magic Mouth.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] and [[Sihrr]] make their way down to the [[Hendricks Farm]] to talk to the [[Church of the Falling Fire]] about the situation with the [[Ironhelms]].
	- They are informed that they ([[Church of the Falling Fire]]) want them to stop mining the [[Delerium]] so recklessly. They are strip mining the [[Delerium]].
	- They are told that some of the pilgrims have been attacked by the dwarves by getting close to [[The Smithy]]. Some may have been killed.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] goes back to the house early, casts detect magic to try to find the box that [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] stashed away. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] casts Magic Mouth on the box.
	- "Hi [[Wyldenten Proudsky]] here, don't open this box. We were forced to deliver this box. Our lives are in danger. [[Queen's Men]]. Be careful with the box."
- [[Sihrr]] informs the group somewhere between 4-8 people have been killed by the dwarves. He even tells us that they weren't even given a warning.
- Our party has an heated internal debate about what to do with the dwarves. [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is insisting the dwarves need to be dealt with. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] doesn't really buy it. [[Sihrr]] seems to slightly agree with [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]], [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] just wants to know the truth about whats going on with the dwarves before we take any drastic action.
- We go to meet the dwarves at the [[Red Lion Hotel]] and see a lot of dwarves. It seems a bit heated.
- [[Eloise Ironhelm]] introduces the group to [[Gertrude Ironhelm]].  [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] pipes up that he's the one inquiring about purchasing ammunition. [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] seems to have an arm that is heavily armored, likely can be used as a shield. 
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] hands over the weapon and she disassembles it and tries to buy it off of [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]].
- We're made aware of a fourth dwarven brother named [[Reginald Ironhelm]]
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] makes a deal with [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] for her to be able to study the weapon in exchange for assisting him with crafting ammunition. He is given a receipt from [[Gertrude Ironhelm]]/[[Reginald Ironhelm]] with a full description of the weapon and a contract for the research/ammunition. She will return the weapon with some ammunition to test fire within about 72 hours. He looks at the receipt and sees she is valuing the gun around 4000 gold. 
- [[Sihrr]] tries to convince [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] that the dwarves are eyeing [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] strangely. [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] doesn't really believe him.
- [[Gertrude Ironhelm]] doesn't want us to get a free ticket into their smithy if we aren't truthful with who hired us.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] speaks in [[Gertrude Ironhelm]]'s head and tells her we're not being upfront because pretty much everyone hired us.
- They kind of lock up and take over the [[Red Lion Hotel]] briefly so that we can have our conversation in private.
- We're told the [[Queen's Men]] are being paid 15% of their take for "protection", but they don't feel like they need it anymore. They have plenty of fortifications.
- We're told they can't really deliver what the [[Amethyst Academy]] is asking for in terms of [[Delerium]].
- All of their [[Delerium]] is being sold to [[Fairweather Trades]].
- They aren't getting as much profit as they would like from the [[Delerium]].
- Members of the [[Church of the Falling Fire]] have harassed them, some snuck in at night and they were forced to be dealt with.
	- They climbed their walls at night and tried to sabotage their guns.
	- They justify it as needing protect their own. If their fortifications get damaged or destroyed they can't protect themselves.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] attempts to persuade them to deal with the [[Hooded Lanterns]]
- She tells us that they can't deal with the [[Hooded Lanterns]] unless they can get guaranteed protection.
	- She would deal with the [[Hooded Lanterns]] if they can garrison soldiers.
- We are offered to come spend a night shift at [[The Smithy]] in [[The Scar]] to prove our mettle. This is to give us information to pass back to the [[Hooded Lanterns]] so they understand the deal they are getting into if they provide protection for the [[Ironhelm]] dwarves.
- We're told
	- No fires, no lights. The only light source is a bonfire in the middle of camp.
	- At night, the [[Haze]] recedes away, it appears to go up into the atmosphere and creates a corona in the sky.
	- We might have some dim light but might not be able to see more than 90 feet or so away from the walls.
- We arrive that evening at [[The Smithy]] in [[The Scar]] without any encounters. It's quite dark here. There is a light coming from the bonfire in the middle.
- Along with us at [[The Smithy]], there is [[Gertrude Ironhelm]], [[Mordecai Ironhelm]], and about 10 other dwarves, some of whom are going to head back as our team is giving them the night off to rest.
- [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] asks about the best area to defend from the biggest baddies.
- It's quite dark. [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] is super excited to get to help man the guns.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] has free reign on the guns. Takes a full turn to shoot it, another turn to reload one.
- The fortification walls are about 4 feet tall. The buildings have about 10 foot walls. 
- We take up positions to defend [[The Smithy]]
- About two hours pass. Looking out over [[The Scar]] we see glows peppering the area. We start to hear sounds shuffling and moaning. The sounds are distant at first, but start to seem to come closer and closer. 
- We're assaulted by a group of 12 Haze Husk creatures.
- [[Arken Highbloom|Arken]] is the first to get a kill. The creature had some amount of health less than 16+9 (25)
- First round is over. Moaning gets worse. Six more Haze Husks appear, bringing the total to 18.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] and [[Keth Darklighter|Keth]] pick off two more. They seem to have a localized explosion when they die. Not sure what the effect of it will be.
- Six more Haze Husks appear at the end of the second round.
- One of the thugs gains a level of [[Contamination]] after failing a con save due to an explosion.
- Six more Haze Husks appear at the beginning of round four.
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] leaves off with wanting to order the spider to fall back and web things to get them slowed
- A large creature appears to the southeast. It appears to be a Haze Hulk, but its a bit different than what we've seen in the past. 
- [[Wyldenten Proudsky|Wyl]] wants to fire the cannon at that sucker.
