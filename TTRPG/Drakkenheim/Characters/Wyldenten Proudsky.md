## **Summary**

Wyldenten Proudsky was a ghostwise halfling and arcane tinkerer, originally hailing from the ruined city of Drakkenheim. Quirky, inventive, and emotionally volatile, Wyldenten’s contributions to the party included magical item crafting, scouting, and creative problem solving—often accompanied by a deep personal vulnerability. His journey was defined by obsession with his family’s fate, an erratic moral compass, and eventual collapse under the city's corrupting pressures. Wyldenten ultimately died in Session 25, executed by the Hooded Lanterns after betraying them while under immense psychological and political duress.

## **Motivations**

At his core, Wyldenten was driven by a desperate hope: that his family had somehow survived the cataclysm that destroyed Drakkenheim. This belief propelled him back into the city’s depths, seeking out ruins of his childhood home and business, even recovering a family safe and heirlooms. That pursuit increasingly twisted into a fixation, his emotional state fraying further each time reality failed to meet his hopes.

Beyond family, he was motivated by:

- A desire to leave a mark—often through magical creations or legacy-building gestures like “customer loyalty cards” or self-branded constructs.
    
- A need for control amidst chaos, manifesting in compulsive tinkering or attempts to shape situations magically, even when ill-advised.
    
- A fragile sense of self-worth that often led to retreat, avoidance, or poor judgment under pressure.

## **Major Events**

- **Return to Drakkenheim**: Wyldenten’s early goals centered on finding his childhood home. He eventually located the ruins of his family’s shop, discovering the safe and a journal locked with his birthday and parents’ anniversary—proof of his deep emotional ties and nostalgic reasoning.
    
- **Contamination and Mutation**: While adventuring in the tunnels beneath the Rat’s Nest, Wyldenten was mutated by exposure to Delirium. He lost teeth and nails, became capable of crawling on walls, and began to unravel emotionally. He later had his corruption cleansed at the Chapel of Saint Ardenna, but the scars remained.
    
- **Black Ivory Inn Incident**: Wyldenten became convinced that the group had traveled back in time, possibly to the day of the meteor strike. He suffered a breakdown and panicked about altering the timeline. During this arc, he died fighting an aberration in the tunnels, only to return via a potion, physically restored and more youthful—a second chance he never truly came to terms with.
    
- **Moral Fracture and Isolation**: Increasingly distanced from party decisions and key conversations, Wyldenten focused on personal projects and moments of distraction. As the campaign wore on, he grew unpredictable—using force over diplomacy, pursuing side goals alone, and struggling with the consequences of past actions.
    
- **Betrayal and Death**: Wyldenten, under threat and manipulation by the Queen’s Men, facilitated the delivery of a package that led to significant harm to the Hooded Lanterns—a group he had once respected and attempted to ally with. Despite likely feeling cornered and coerced, the betrayal was clear. The Hooded Lanterns executed him in Session 25, marking the end of his arc with brutal finality.
