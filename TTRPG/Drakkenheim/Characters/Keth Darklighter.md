## **Summary**

Keth Darklighter is a cunning rogue from the Underdark, known for her sharp tongue, impulsive deals, and the trail of chaos that seems to follow her. The sole female in the party and now its de facto leader, Keth has carved out a name for herself in the shadows of Drakkenheim—not just as a survivor, but as a power broker. From humble beginnings, she has risen to lead a syndicate of thieves and outcasts known as Keth’s Krew, operating from Buckle Down Row. Despite dying twice over the course of her adventures, she remains a defiant, unkillable force—equal parts liability and legend.

## **Motivations**

Keth is driven by equal parts survival instinct, ambition, and a desperate desire to cut herself free from the bonds of her past. Her actions are frequently self-serving, but not without a weird kind of loyalty to those she’s deemed worthy of trust. Key motivators include:

- **Freedom from Vaddix**: Her original goal was singular—secure enough wealth or leverage to pay off a life-debt owed to the mind flayer Vaddix. That sword over her head shaped much of her early behavior.
    
- **Power and Autonomy**: Keth doesn’t take orders easily and hates being owned—by a mind flayer, a fiend, or fate. Her ascension to leadership over a faction in Buckle Down Row reflects her refusal to remain a pawn.
    
- **Impulse and Opportunity**: Keth rarely plans past the next gamble. Deals are made on instinct, and consequences are tomorrow’s problem. This keeps her dangerous, unpredictable, and often one mistake away from disaster.

## **Major Events**

- **Underdark Origins & Debt to Vaddix**: Keth emerged from the Underdark with a mind flayer's leash around her neck. That dark connection lingered, haunting her interactions and compelling her toward dangerous coin and influence. Victory in the Pits—slaying the Queen’s Champion—secured her freedom, repaying the debt in full.
    
- **Milando’s Deal**: In a classic Keth move, she entered into a bargain with a charming stranger later revealed to be the fiend Milando. The cost? Her soul, or something close to it. This deal still casts a long shadow, and its implications may not be done unraveling.
    
- **Death & Resurrection (Twice)**: Keth has died on two separate occasions, only to claw her way back to life. Whether by divine intervention, sheer narrative spite, or unfinished business, her returns have only emboldened her defiance of death and authority alike.
    
- **Rise of Keth’s Krew**: After surviving and then seizing power during a factional power struggle, Keth rebranded a gang in Buckle Down Row under her own name. “Keth’s Krew” now operates under her rule, handling smuggling, sabotage, and other criminal endeavors throughout the city. Her leadership is unconventional, often chaotic, but surprisingly effective.
    
- **Reputation as a Deal-Maker (and Breaker)**: Keth’s most defining trait may be her unchecked impulse to make deals with anyone offering a shortcut. From tavern crooks to demonic patrons, she's quick to agree and slow to consider. This has repeatedly plunged the party into dangerous situations—but it's also opened doors no one else could.

## Backstory

Keth Morikalina (Common translation "Darklighter") was a member of an aristocratic family of nobles in the Underdark. Her mother was a Professor of Alchemy at the College of Witchcraft in Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Her father was a well-respected doctor, and the personal physician of two of the eight Matron Mothers of the ruling council. They owned many slaves.

No one familiar with House Morikalina would ever have expected their eldest daughter, Keth, the jewel of her mother's eye, the one deemed most capable of assassinating her way onto the council, would ever forsake her many birthrights for a life of crime spent fraternizing among the lesser races.

Nevertheless, Keth had made her choices, and inevitably ran afoul of Vaddix El-Vuss, an infamous Illithid crime boss who ruled the vile underworld of Menzoberranzan.

Keth had made a name for herself as a talented thief and smuggler, and so was often employed by the El-Vuss organization to transport illegal artifacts out of the city and up to the surfacelands of men and mer.

During one such run, Keth made a mistake, and trusted the wrong fence. While traveling a treacherous mountain road high atop a dormant volcano, a cadre of Aarakocra sky wardens descended on her convoy to screen for contraband moving through their territory. Keth was forced to send an entire wagonload of highly-illegal iocane root over the ledge into a caldera to keep from being discovered.

She has not returned to the Underdark since. Vaddix El-Vuss is furious, and has spent a fortune trying to find her. He will have his money or he will have her life.


### Personal Quest

**Overwhelming Debt**
I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000 gp to Vaddix El-Vuss, an Illithid mobster operating out of the City of Spiders, Drow capitol of the Underdark. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor sent to kill me.
