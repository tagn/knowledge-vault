## **Summary**

Nox is a reclusive tiefling warlock whose arrival marked a turning point in the party’s journey. He first appeared at the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, bearing one of the elusive Seals of Drakkenheim—an item of major interest to the party and their allies. Rarely seen without his unsettling companion, a small Beholder named Gutter, Nox carries an aura of quiet menace and ambiguity. His pact with an unknown patron fuels his arcane power, but little is known about its terms—or what price he may have already paid. Though not entirely trusted, Nox has joined the party in several key ventures, choosing to align with them—at least for now.

## **Motivations**

Nox keeps his cards close. His motivations are speculative at best, and his allegiance appears to be conditional:

- **Unknown Patron**: His power comes from a mysterious otherworldly entity, the nature of which he has yet to reveal. It’s unclear whether Nox serves willingly, grudgingly, or under duress—but whatever the case, it clearly colors his choices.
    
- **Strategic Alignment**: Nox’s decision to hand over a Seal and accompany the party suggests a long-game strategy. Whether he's using the group as leverage, protection, or distraction is still unknown.

#### **Major Events**

- **Arrival with the Seal**: Nox entered the campaign already carrying one of the Seals of Drakkenheim—a major objective for the party. This act earned him a degree of trust, or at least utility, in the eyes of the group and their Church allies.
    
- **Gutter the Beholder**: One of Nox’s most visible and unsettling traits is his companion, Gutter—a small Beholder-like creature whose presence hints at aberrant magic or extraplanar influence. Gutter is both unnerving and oddly charming, but few trust the creature—or its master.
    
- **Unwilling Adventurer**: Though Nox has joined the party on major outings, his participation often feels reluctant. He fights, casts, and contributes when needed.
    
- **A Growing Wild Card**: With power, artifacts, and a patron of unknown nature, Nox remains the most enigmatic member of the party. His future intentions are a question mark, and the consequences of his pact may eventually drag the group into deeper, stranger conflicts.
