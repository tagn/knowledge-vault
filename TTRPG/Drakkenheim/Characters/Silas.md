## **Summary**

Silas Nightshade is a haunted apothecary and exorcist, once a Sea Elf turned Hexblood in service to a powerful Hag known as Grandmother. Initially joining the party with secret intentions, Silas sought to retrieve a magical artifact for his patron. However, his faith in her began to erode as her commands turned more twisted and cruel. Eventually, this culminated in betrayal, exposure, and a confrontation that led the party into the Feywild to destroy Grandmother. Now restored to his original Sea Elf form through the arcane power of the Inscrutable Tower, Silas has cast off his cursed past. A devout follower of the frost giant god Thrym, Silas balances a cold, resolute philosophy with a growing warmth toward his companions. Though once a spy, he is now a brother in arms—and perhaps, for the first time, his own person.

## **Motivations**

Silas is a character in transition—his motivations have evolved alongside his transformation:

- **Service to Grandmother (Formerly)**: Silas was shaped by a lifetime of servitude under a manipulative Hag. He carried out her will not out of love, but from indoctrination and a belief that he owed her everything.
    
- **Redemption and Restoration**: Following his betrayal of the party and subsequent punishment, Silas has worked to earn back their trust and redefine his identity apart from Grandmother’s influence.
    
- **Devotion to Thrym**: As a follower of the Frost Giant deity, Silas reveres strength, endurance, and the power of winter. His faith in Thrym gives him a source of stability—an anchor that survived even his transformation and exile from Grandmother.
    
- **Protection Through Knowledge**: As an exorcist and apothecary, Silas seeks to fight corruption and spiritual affliction—not only because he understands them, but because he’s lived as their agent. His mission now is to contain the rot rather than spread it.

## **Major Events**

- **Hexblood Origins & Secret Agenda**: Once a Sea Elf, Silas was offered up to Grandmother in a deal that twisted his form and bound his soul. His first mission for her in Drakkenheim was the retrieval of the Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio—a mission he completed by betraying his companions.
    
- **Exposure and Punishment**: After his theft was revealed, Silas was stripped of his hag-granted powers. This moment forced him to come clean to the party and marked a turning point—his first step toward reclaiming autonomy.
    
- **Journey to the Feywild**: To retrieve the stolen phylactery and confront Grandmother, the party entered the Feywild. There, Grandmother was slain, and Silas’s link to her was severed. It was a moment of freedom—but also grief, as part of him had only known life under her dominion.
    
- **Restoration in the Inscrutable Tower**: With his pact broken, Silas was restored to his true Sea Elf form by the arcane forge within the Inscrutable Tower. This physical transformation symbolized a rebirth—not just as an individual, but as a member of the party in full.
    
- **Faith in Thrym**: Throughout all of this, Silas’s connection to the Frost Giant deity Thrym has remained. In Thrym’s cold, relentless philosophy, Silas finds discipline and divine strength to continue forward—especially as he rededicates himself to helping the innocent and protecting the fragile hope still left in Drakkenheim.
