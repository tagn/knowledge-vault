## What You Know About _Delirium_

### 1. **Delirium is the fallout from the meteor.**

- It's a crystalline substance created by the meteor impact that destroyed Drakkenheim.
    
- The “star that came” is even worshipped by the **Church of the Falling Fire**, who revere the meteor as divine, Delirium included.

### 2. **It’s _extremely_ dangerous.**

- Touching it with bare skin is explicitly warned against.
    
- Exposure causes **contamination**—which leads to corruption, mutation, and eventually total physical and mental degeneration.
    
    - Examples:
        
        - A delirium dreg killed in Session 001 was _mutated within 48 hours_.
            
        - Wyldenten lost teeth and fingernails, and spat up a black chalky substance after being contaminated.
            
        - Flamekeeper Hannah has a Delirium shard embedded in her chest and is slowly changing.

### 3. **It has _magical properties_, but is volatile.**

- It hums, glows at night or when exposed to magic, and reacts strongly to magical contact.
    
- Some potions and items created from it—like **Aqua Delirium**—offer potent benefits but carry huge risks (e.g., triggering wild magical anomalies on spellcasting).
    
- **Amethyst Academy** uses ground-up Delirium as a substitute for rare magical components.

### 4. **It comes in multiple forms.**

- **Fragments** (e.g., small chips you’ve sold for 100g each)
    
- **Crystals** (larger chunks, pumpkin-sized geodes exist)
    
- **Powdered form** (used in rituals, spells, and alchemical mixtures)
    
- **Liquid form** (used in potions like Aqua Delirium)

### 5. **It causes mutation in living things.**

- You’ve fought:
    
    - **Ratlings** twisted by exposure
        
    - **Haze Hulks**—massive mutated monsters
        
    - _Mutated NPCs_, like Marco the Shark who turned in front of a crowd before being executed
        
- **Creatures near large quantities of Delirium change faster**, and more dramatically.

### 6. **It’s mined and traded like a resource.**

- There’s a whole Delirium economy in Drakkenheim:
    
    - **The Amethyst Academy** seeks large pieces for research and magical purposes.
        
    - **The Ironhelms**, a group of dwarves, mine and sell it (possibly to the Queen's Men).
        
    - **Merchants** like Aldor the Immense sell Delirium-based items.
        
    - **You** have sold fragments and bartered it for magic items and potions.
        
- Handling and transporting it requires special tools, containers, and protection—pamphlets and gear were issued to your party for safe extraction.
    

---

### 7. **It’s central to the city’s factions and conflicts.**

- The Hooded Lanterns want to **destroy all Delirium**.
    
- The Amethyst Academy wants to **study and harness it**.
    
- The Queen’s Men want to **profit off of it** (or weaponize it).
    
- The Church sees it as **divine**.
	
- The Knights of the Silver Order want to **destroy all Delirium**.

## Working Theories From What You've Seen

- **It's likely otherworldly**—not just magical, but possibly planar in origin.
    
- It may **weaken the veil between realms**, leading to temporal loops (Black Ivory Inn), magical anomalies, and psychic phenomena (e.g., your dreams, voices, or paranoia).
    
- Its effects aren’t just physical—they mess with your **mind, memories, and soul**.
