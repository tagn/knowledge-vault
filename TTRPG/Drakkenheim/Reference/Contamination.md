## What You Know About _Contamination_

### 1. **It’s caused by exposure to Delirium and the Haze.**

- Prolonged exposure—even indirect contact—can infect a person.
    
- Touching Delirium raw, inhaling the Haze, or being attacked by corrupted creatures can all cause it.
    
- Even _near proximity_ seems dangerous over time (e.g., carrying it unshielded, walking through heavy Haze areas).

### 2. **It starts subtle—and gets horrifying.**

Contamination symptoms include:

- Fingernails and toenails falling out (Wyldenten)
    
- Teeth thinning and crumbling
    
- Hair loss
    
- Black, chalky discharge (when spitting, vomiting, or sweating)
    
- Internal changes (possibly magical or anatomical)
    

These were noted after Wyldenten’s encounters with ratlings and corrupted entities.

### 3. **It leads to _mutations_.**

- Some effects are mechanical (e.g., mutations from a table).
    
- Others are narrative—Wyldenten gained wall-crawling abilities after being _mutated by the Rat Prince_.
    
- Arken received a mutation from touching Flamekeeper Hannah’s Delirium shard.
    
- Mutations range from minor cosmetic changes to full-blown physical transformations, depending on exposure and rolls.

### 4. **It is _cumulative_ and persistent.**

- Once Contaminated, you stay that way unless cured.
    
- Repeated exposure makes it worse.
    
- It appears to have “levels” or severity tiers that affect how likely mutations or permanent effects are to manifest.

### 5. **There are ways to remove it—but all have costs.**

- 🛐 **Flamekeeper Hannah** (Church of the Falling Fire) offers cleansing for 250 gold.
    
    - But Wyldenten lost the contamination **only to gain four levels of exhaustion**.
        
- 🧙‍♀️ **Old Zoya** (Shrine of the Old Gods) also offers cleansing for 250 gold, but your party didn't follow through in that session.
    
- 🤯 **You can’t ignore it.** Party members who waited too long started falling apart physically, or losing cognitive integrity (Wyldenten and Arken post-Inn incident).

### 6. **It’s spiritually or magically tainting.**

- There's an implication that contamination isn't just biological—it affects your **soul, alignment, and essence**.
    
- Oscar Yorn’s research hinted at using corrupted fauna and Delirium to brew potions.
    
- The Falling Fire cult worships the meteor, which suggests some religious orders see contamination as a “blessing” or transformation.
    
- The Delirium shard inside Flamekeeper Hannah is _alive_, and possibly changing her from within.
