## ðŸŒ€ What We Know About _The Haze_ in Drakkenheim

**1. It's everywhere near the city.** The Haze is a constant environmental threat enveloping Drakkenheim, particularly within the city walls. Itâ€™s one of the primary reasons the city remains so deadly, even years after the meteor impact.

**2. It is a byproduct of Delirium.** Deliriumâ€”the crystalized magical residue from the meteorâ€”is central to the Haze. Prolonged exposure to Delirium or its unrefined form seems to create or amplify the Haze. Youâ€™ve seen creatures mutated by it, and it's suspected to be a vector for _contamination_ and mutation.

**3. Itâ€™s not just visualâ€”itâ€™s magical and corruptive.** The Haze isn't just fog. It's laced with arcane corruption. Extended exposure mutates living creatures (e.g., turning people into _Haze Hulks_ or _Delirium Dregs_), causes madness, and seems to affect time and space in some areas (e.g., the temporal anomaly at the Black Ivory Inn).

**4. The Haze can manifest physical and magical anomalies.** Youâ€™ve seen:

- Mutated monsters like _Haze Hulks_ and _Haze Husks_
    
- Spell effects behaving unpredictably
    
- Environments caught in magical loops (see: Black Ivory Inn)
    
- People losing their memory or becoming part of the Haze itself
    

**5. Exposure has lasting consequences.** Characters who've been corrupted suffer physical mutationsâ€”Wyldentenâ€™s missing teeth and fingernails, hair loss, etc. These can be cured (e.g., via Flamekeeper Hannah or Old Zoya), but not without cost (like exchanging corruption for exhaustion or payment).

**6. The river is contaminated too.** The river near Drakkenheim is also Haze-tainted. It smells foul, has creatures in it, and the contamination seems to spread through the water. Even distant travel along the river is risky.

**7. No one really controls it.** Despite efforts from the **Amethyst Academy**, **Hooded Lanterns**, and religious factions, no one fully understands or can dispel the Haze. There are methods to temporarily shield against it (e.g., potions like _Aqua Delirium_), but permanent solutions are elusive.

## So Whatâ€™s the Haze, Really?

Your group hasnâ€™t pinned down exactly _what_ the Haze isâ€”whether it's a magical disease, a natural phenomenon from the meteor, a curse, or some blend of all three. But every clue points to it being deeply tied to:

- **Delirium exposure**
    
- **The meteor impact**
    
- **The destabilization of magical and planar boundaries**
    

And itâ€™s only getting worse.
