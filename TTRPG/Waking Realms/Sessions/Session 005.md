- We have a job from the "Jolly Shadow", which is some sort of underground faction. 
- We're in some Tavern, Smoking Mirror exits her room, her guards stand immediate and begin to follow her. She doesn't even give us a glance as she passes by us and heads to the bar, pours herself a glass of wine, then walks out the door in the back.
- Drovak goes and knocks on the wrong door. A halfling man attempts to mate with him. He heads back to the bar, and ends up booking a room for himself.
- Bring up the encounter with the halfling, ask where they slept. The halflings in this place are lustful.
- "The cure for honesty" is the slogan of the store.
- Drovak purchases a potion of "Water Breathing" from the shop.
- Serena donates some gold to someone on the street.
- At the barnacle thing, Drovak hears someone talking that the Coin Dancers are looking for people to go and put a stop to the raiding happening. They are sick of it, and considering signing up because they are supposed to be paying fairly well.
