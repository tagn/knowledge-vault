- Last session we ended after completing our "successful" takeover of the pirate ship. Did some investigation, chose to sink the ship, then made our way to Rugosa where we docked for repairs on our ship and walked around a bit and did some shopping.
- Ty'riok uses some new cantrip to get information on the piece of cloth that Drovak holds. The cloth is made of silk, and is common and can come from multiple places of the world. It could come from the Echolands, the sanctified realm, and the pridelands. The ink used to make the patterns is more rare on the cloth comes from a region of the Pridelands.
- He uses it on the other trinkets found in the boxes of the pirate ship, and the bowls come from Cerulset. The knives come from the Sanctified Realms.
-  Rinn attempts to find a weapon shop, but nobody seems to pay him any attention.
- We wander around the city to find an establishment that we can rest at for the next few days. We find a domed place called the Cracked Carapace. We find a table and decide to get 3 rooms. Vaelion approaches an attractive Tortle. We pay 3 gold for rooms, paying a higher price than the merchants would normally get.
- The other patrons at the inn seem to be avoiding interacting with us. The vibe is fairly quiet compared to most taverns.
- The oldest Tortle we've ever seen slowly makes his way over to bring us food. Vaelion goes over to ask him if he needs help, and there is a gasp around the inn at the offence. He says his name is Nok, it is his tavern, and he apologizes for the slow service. He seemed fairly offended at our quickness.
- Looks like a job for a Drovak. He makes his way over to another table with a stack of bowls. My name is Maressa. Drovak gets no information for some reason, after boasting about his pirate slaying and kraken scaring.
- Vaelion offends Nok once again.
- We make our way to the rooms we purchased, and the keys that we have are made of stone.
- There are no doors on the inn rooms. There are hanging screens and mats. In the rooms there are shell cradles, rather than beds. They are designed to distribute shell weight evenly. There are also piles of straw and blankets for those who do not want to sleep in the cradles.
- Outside of the inn in the morning, we find one of our crew waiting for us. The captain told him to come give us an update. They'll probably have the ship fixed in a day or two. The ship was fairly fucked. Alessia said she would split the cost. Drovak pays the crewman 27 gold for our share plus for him to get some food for the crew. Vaelion tells him to be meaner to the crew. Ty'riok repays Drovak his gold so Drovak gives him a stern reply, to Vaelions dismay.
- Rinn asks for a rather unique Haft to use for a dual-bladed weapon. They don't have any knowledge of something like it, but then later one of the shopkeepers comes back out with a card directing Rinn to try some other place. It's a place called the Deep Shelf.
- Drovak buys 8 daggers and straps to hold them, then straps them all over his arms and legs.
- We make our way over to the Deep Shelf. It looks like a house, rather than a store. We go inside and the place seems to be laid out less like a shop, and more like a repository. They have a lot of curious wares for sale. We're introduced to Eshuun, who happens to have precisely what Rinn was seeking. It is given at no cost, as these items should belong with whom they are destined for.
- Vaelion finds a part of the "prow" of a triton ship, that was destroyed.
