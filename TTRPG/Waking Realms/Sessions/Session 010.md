 - Serena tosses the captains crossbow straight off the side of the ship.
 - Ty'riok uses spare the dying to prevent the Captain from dying.
 - The captain wakes up, reaches for his rapier which is gone, and tells us to go fuck ourselves.
 - Drovak ties the captains feet with a rope and hangs him upside down from a mast then ties it off so he just dangles.
 - We have our ships carpenter come over to assess the damage with us to see if the ship can be taken back to shore.
 - We head down the stairs below deck on the ship. The underside of the ship is mostly a cargo hold. There is a prisoner section. The rest of the space is filled with crates, barrels, boxes, and other storage containers. There is no space for anyone to sleep and no sight of any slaves or captives.
 - Serena detects some sort of desecration/hallowed effect on some of the crates. Vaelion also detects magic from them. They smell waxy.
 - We open the first crate and there are layers of cloth that Drovak recognizes as the Crimson Sigil, who attacked his people. Inside the box under cloth are stacks of red candles.
 - Drovak opens a second crate, which is also wrapped. It's filled with silver bowls. Not quite chalices, but they have a base to them. They are inlayed with the same pattern on the cloth.
 - Inside a third crate is something wrapped with cloth and hay, as if its more fragile. It's filled with ritual daggers.
 - The fourth box is empty, but Vaelion senses magic shrouding something. Drovak reaches into the shroud and pulls out a small skull of child. Serena is distraught with rage at the sight of this, and takes one of the skulls back upstairs to contront the captain, who is named K'yokiir. We find quite a large amount of these skulls, bleached white and pristine, within this crate.
 - Serena executes the captain after he refuses to give any information about where the cargo came from. She then skewers his head on a spike.
 - Serena heads back down into the cargo hold and collects the skulls in a sack and takes them back up to the deck, then begins loading them into the ships life raft.
 - Odemeaus comes over and pulls Vaelion aside to advice him that ditching the life raft to do a viking-style funeral for the skulls isn't the most wise thing to do if we're repairing the ship to take.
 - The ship is going to be dropping stuff off in Cerelset, and another in Gloomwatch.
 - Most of the "legit" goods seemed to come from a place called the Black Bean Depot. The less savory goods seemed to come from the Iron Locked Store.
 - We decide to ignite the ship to sink it, and start heading towards Rugosa.
 - We level up to 4, while heading to Rugosa.

   ## Session Summary - Picking up from last session

- **Serena** tosses the captain’s crossbow overboard.
- **Ty’riok** uses _Spare the Dying_ to prevent the captain from bleeding out.
- The captain regains consciousness, reaches for his missing rapier, and tells the party to go fuck themselves.
- **Drovak** ties the captain’s feet with a rope, hangs him upside down from the mast, and secures him so he dangles helplessly.
- The ship’s carpenter is brought over to assess the damage and determine whether the vessel can be repaired well enough to return to shore.

### Below Decks

- The party heads below deck. Most of the lower level is a cargo hold with a small prisoner section.
- The rest of the space is filled with crates, barrels, boxes, and other containers. There is no sleeping area and no sign of slaves or living captives.
- **Serena** detects a desecrated or unhallowed presence coming from some of the crates.
- **Vaelion** also detects magic emanating from them. The crates have a faint, waxy smell.

### The Crates

- The first crate is opened. Inside are layers of cloth that **Drovak** recognizes as belonging to the **Crimson Sigil**, the group that previously attacked his people. Beneath the cloth are stacks of red candles.
- The second crate, similarly wrapped, contains silver bowls—not quite chalices, but each has a base to stand on its own. They are inlaid with the same symbol found on the cloth.
- A third crate contains something more carefully packed with cloth and hay, suggesting fragility. Inside are ritual daggers.
- The fourth crate appears empty, but **Vaelion** senses magic shrouding something unseen.
    - **Drovak** reaches into the magical veil and pulls out a small child’s skull.
    - Further investigation reveals many more skulls in the crate—bleached white, pristine, and numerous.
    - **Serena**, overcome with rage and grief, takes one of the skulls back up to the deck to confront the captain, whose name is revealed to be **K’yokiir**.

### The Captain’s Fate

- **Serena** demands answers about the origin of the cargo.
- K’yokiir refuses to provide any information.
- **Serena** executes him and mounts his head on a spike.

### Aftermath and Decisions

- **Serena** returns below deck, gathers the skulls into a sack, and brings them up onto the deck.
- She begins loading them into the ship’s lifeboat, intending to give them a Viking-style funeral.
- **Odemeaus** pulls **Vaelion** aside and advises that ditching the lifeboat may not be wise if the party intends to repair or commandeer the ship.

    - Legitimate goods were shipped from a location called **Black Bean Depot**.
