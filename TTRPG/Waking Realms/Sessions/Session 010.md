 - Serena tosses the captains crossbow straight off the side.
 - Ty'riok uses spare the dying to prevent the Captain from dying.
 - The captain wakes up, reaches for his rapier which is gone, and tells us to go fuck ourselves.
 - Drovak ties the captains feet with a rope and hangs him upside down from a mast then ties it off so he just dangles.
 - We head down the stairs below deck on the ship. The underside of the ship is mostly a cargo hold. There is a prisoner section. The rest of the space is filled with crates, barrels, boxes, and other storage containers. There is no space for anyone to sleep and no sight of any slaves or captives.
 - Serena detects some sort of descration/hallowed effect on some of the crates. Vaelion also detects magic from them. They smell waxy.
 - We open a crate and there are layers of cloth that Drovak recognizes as who attacked his people. Inside the box under cloth are stacks of red candles.
 -  Drovak opens a second crate, which is also wrapped. It's filled with silver bowls. Not quite chalices, but they have a base to them. They are inlayed with the same pattern on the cloth.
 - Inside a third crate is something wrapped with cloth and hay, as if its more fragile. It's filled with ritual daggers.
 - The fourth box is empty, but Vaelion senses magic shrouding something. Drovak pulls out what appears to be a skull of a baby or small child.
 - Serena storms off upstairs to confront the captain, named K'yokiir.
 - Serena executes the captain after he refuses to give any information about where the cargo came from.
 - Odemeaus comes over and pulls Vaelion aside.
