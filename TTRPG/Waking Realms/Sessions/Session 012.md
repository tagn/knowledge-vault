1. **Recap** The crew returned to Bilge City after a pirate-avoided sail, during which Vaelion rescued a triton named Thalryss and fended off a water elemental with a surprise gust of wind (and an emergency octopus transformation). Nightmares plagued much of the party, but in town they got the comatose Thalryss healed at a temple—turns out necromancy was at work, but some old-school curse-breaking got their new friend back on his (naked) feet. After epic arm wrestling, recap of pirate economics, and some late-night vigilante coin-justice from Rinn, the group rendezvoused with Fibblo, got paid, and lined up their next gig: taking down the Mamba Band's warehouses in Corvosa, with hints of darker cult business afoot. No more baby skull candles, please.
    
2. **Fun Moments**
    
    - Vaelion Brinecrest, in peak awkward pirate innuendo: "Couple hand in hand job. It's whatever you're trying to."
    - Serena Duskbane, on the ship's pricing: "You guys definitely got charged exploitative tourist prices effectively."
    - Rinn Stormblood, expressing true character spirit: "Go big or go the fuck home. Yes."
    - GM, on the party’s exhausting dreams: "You had a bad day. Alright. Let me get things situated here."
    - Ty'riok Thornebrand, flaunting his wisdom save: "Says Vaelion with a 23 wisdom saving."
    
3. **Key Points**
    
    1. We spotted the Weeping Orc, a large pirate ship belonging to the Crowsnest faction, flying a white flag, which could signal a desire to parlay or a deception.
    2. Rinn identified the Weeping Orc as well-armed and about 50% larger than our ship, with three sails; a white or black flag can mean a desire to parlay.
    3. A water elemental, likely conjured by someone on the pirate ship, approached us and created a frozen plank toward our ship, signaling a desire for parlay or communication.
    4. Vaelion communicated with the elemental in Aquan and learned it was a conjured servant sent by its master on the pirate ship to initiate a parlay.
    5. Vaelion refused the elemental's invitation to board the ice bowl transport, used Gust of Wind to escape, and returned to our ship as an octopus.
    6. After Vaelion's refusal, the elemental returned to the pirate ship, which then lowered its white flag and cleared our path to Build City, avoiding direct confrontation.
    7. We did not get close enough to identify anyone on the pirate ship, and no further flags were raised after the white flag was lowered.
    8. Alicia returned to the Coin Dancers and invited us to meet her and Fibblo the next day for payment and future plans.
    9. Vaelion warned the Coin Dancers' crew that the cargo (candles) caused nightmares and advised caution, but did not mention the baby skulls.
    10. Frank, the rescued sailor, is now considered part of the crew and will remain with them.
    11. We took rooms at the Shouting Sail Tavern and brought the unconscious triton with us, not hiding his identity.
    12. Vaelion stayed with the triton while Serena and Rinn searched for a healer at the Temple of Ramil, a known place of healing for those in sorrow.
    13. Lorena, the healer at the Temple of Ramil, agreed to attempt to heal the triton if we brought him to the temple, and clarified that no payment was required (donations optional).
    
4. 14. Lorena detected necromantic magic emanating from the triton's chest using Detect Magic, which is highly taboo and discouraged in the Waking Realms.
    15. Lorena cast Lesser Restoration (no effect), then successfully removed a curse, causing the necromantic magic to dissipate and reviving the triton.
    16. The triton identified himself as Thalryss of the Falling Current, a tide warden (military leader) from a triton city in the Thousand Eyes region.
    17. Thalryss possesses a magical, animated map tattoo on his arm that shows live weather and storm patterns in the Thousand Eyes, which he uses to avoid the Kraken's storms.
    18. Thalryss confirmed that multiple triton cities remain under siege by Kuo-Toa and the Kraken ('the Bane'), but all are isolated and have had no contact for years.
    19. The Kraken is described as a massive, city-destroying creature whose tentacles alone are over 100 feet long, and is the primary threat to the triton cities.
    20. Thalryss offered future aid if we visit his city, and said we can communicate one-way with him via Ty'riok's message spell (limited to 8 characters).
    21. We received 700 gold as payment for our previous mission (sinking two pirate ships and selling cargo).
    22. Fibblo warned us that the Mamba Band is likely on alert at sea and suggested we avoid naval confrontations for now.
    23. Our new mission is to strike at Mamba Band warehouses in Corvosa to undermine their economic power and destabilize their control over the city.
    24. Fibblo provided a list of known Mamba Band warehouses: Stonehook Yards, Ironlock Stores, Low Tide Lockup, Driftmark Warehouse, Saltwind Exchange, and Gallowstock (noted as central).
    25. Suspicious cargo (like the cursed candles) was previously traced to the Ironlock Store; legitimate goods came from Black Bean Depot.
    26. We can choose which warehouse to target, and Fibblo will arrange for us to be smuggled into Corvosa with a cover identity when ready.
     27. Fibblo offered us a suite at the casino for the night, free drinks, and promised a magic item reward at breakfast before we depart for Corvosa.
