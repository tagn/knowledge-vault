- We make our way with our captive towards Rugosa, but encounter a shipwreck that we decide to stop and investigate at the suggestion of our Captain.
- The people that went to shore are rather creeped out by what they found.
- The boat was very large, and from an unrecognizable faction or group. 
- The ship could have had 20 cannons on each side, which is larger than most military ships we've ever seen.
