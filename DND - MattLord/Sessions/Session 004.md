## Event Log

- We wake up, looks like the goblins are carving up the dragon corpse.
- We go to check on the prisoner for some reason, I guess the group met with Durn while I was still sleeping.
- We end up slaughtering a bunch of Goblins. I don't think the townspeople are getting that fruit anymore.
- We kill even more goblins. Apparently some of them had kids. Whoops. Durn said something about wanting to get them somewhere. The goblins now seem fearful.
