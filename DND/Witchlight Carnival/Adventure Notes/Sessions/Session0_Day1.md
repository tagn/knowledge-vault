## Location - Witchlight Carnival
- Encountered a Harengon who seemed to be the one that sent us the letters.
	- He told us about the "Prismere(?)"
- Ticket-man Nicolas gave us tickets in exchange for a rule being played on us
	- I must compliment everyone that I meet while at the Carnival
	- It's unclear as to what the consequence of not following this is
- Wandered to the Lost Possessions booth
	- Encountered girl named Dirla, a large Cat, and a boy named Viro
	- We were told that "what was lost could not be retrieved"
	- Viro ran away, we were asked to get the him back
	- Gizzerk talked the Viro into returning
	- Cat thanked us telepathically
- Went over to the Dragonfly rides
