## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We enter Bavlornas cottage
- Gizzerk makes some noise in the cottage
- Dreyloch opens a nearby door to a balcony that has the clotheslines we clearly cut
> This ten-foot-wide balcony runs almost the length of the cottage and is covered from end to end with living frogs. At each end of the balcony, attached to one corner of the cottage just beyond easy reach, is a clothesline draped with patchwork garments. The two lines stretch out over the lake and disappear into the thick fog.
- Lornling right above us watching us
- Turdis attempts to tell it we brought something back for bavlorna and it crawls up and away
- Gizzerk and Dreyloch hold hands and look through the other rooms while Turdis casts detect magic
- Gizzerk and Dreyloch enter a room:
> A horse's head leers at you with glossy eyes, its lips drawn back from pointed yellow teeth. The head is affixed to a large, eight-limbed armature made of wicker and wire, situated so that it faces the doorway where you entered. Near it is a wooden crate.
> 
> Flies buzz about this disordered room, landing occasionally on animal carcasses that lie strewn in small piles. On a low table rests an assortment of tools-saws, knives, scrapers, a hand-cranked drill, sewing thread and needles, and awls-around several taxidermic subjects in various stages of completion. A shelf that looks on the verge of collapse leans against the wall between two windows and bears the weight of dozens of stuffed horrors. Each one is an artless combination of two or more animals.
- Turdis pings numerous magical sources from things in the room
- Gizzerk breaks the mirror and throws it into the well
- The well seems to break down organic materials put in it
- Dreyloch hangs back to identify the well
- Turdis opens up a cupboard, each one stuffed with pouches. Teacup sized "Spittle Spew".
- Gizzerk gets his "crown" stolen from a flying hat
- We go upstairs and burn a wasp nest
- We enter a kitchen and kill some vultures
-
