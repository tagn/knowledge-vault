## Misc Known Information

- Told the following about them from the unicorns at the Carousel in the Witchlight Carnival:
	- Drayloc: 
	 > The hag you seek is allergic to seeing someone run widdershins. Hunt down a rambling cottage on stilts in a fey swamp, you may just find what you are looking for with Bavlorna."
	- Gizzerk:
	 > The hag you seek sleeps in a dollhouse and canâ€™t remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up. Find Skabatha hiding away in a dead, hollowed-out tree in a sylvan forest and you just might just be able to take whats yours back.
	- Turdis:
	 > The hag you seek has foreseen her own death, which happens during an eclipse. Upon an mountaintop theater you may find the peace of mind that was stolen away by Endelyn.

- We know there are at least 3 of them.
- They take things from people visiting the Carnival.
- They seem to each be in some domain of the Prismeer
- They have likely taken from the adventurers and turned what was taken into some sort of magical items.
