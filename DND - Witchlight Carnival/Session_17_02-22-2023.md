## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We are able to get killed by 6 tin soldiers
- We scrape by, killing all the dudes
- We hear some voices from a door halfway up the stairs above us.
- We proceed through a dark ass hallway
> Moths cluster around a lantern that hangs from the ceiling in the middle of a hallway, casting flitting shadows on the walls. The hall contains three sliding doors along the walls, and a heavier hinged door stands at the opposite end.
- We encounter "sowpig", in one of the rooms, and try to convince her to help us. It sounds like she helps granny bring kids to her.
> This room has three doors and a wood-carved staircase that ascends to a higher level. The walls are a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles, nestled among which are five animated portraits: one of a svelte, dark-haired woman and the others depicting hags.
- Gizzerk touches the "everchanging" painting and its essence goes back into him
- Painting appears to be of Tasha
- Turdis tries to take the painting of Scabitha, but it turns into a portrait of his family members
> Three large, freestanding looms dominate this chamber. A young goblin and a pair of gnome children work the machines, filling the room with a loud, rhythmic clatter. A door is set in the opposite wall, and an archway to the east leads to a storeroom.
- We milk another Boggle for Squirt
-
