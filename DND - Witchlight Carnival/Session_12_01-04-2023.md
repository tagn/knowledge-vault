## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- The group discusses the next plan of action
- Turdis and Gizzerk head upstairs to rest

- Lornlings find us an usher us into Bavlornas chamber
- Turdis prepares to talk to bavlorna with a protection from good and evil cast using the scatterleaf tea
- Dreyloch investigates a few rooms
> This room has two exits. Above each door, mounted on a wooden plaque, is a severed goblin head with its mouth agape. Other furnishings include a sideboard, two cupboards with doors made of wood-framed glass, and a large banquet table covered with plates of half-eaten food and a swarm of feasting flies. A chandelier hangs above the table, its tallow candles filling the room with dim, flickering light. Six mismatched chairs flank the table-three chairs per side.
> A contraption made of entangled copper tubes connects to a pot-bellied boiler and a dozen cylindrical containers, which in turn sprout even more tubes that feed into buckets. Barrels are clustered in the southeast corner, and a worktable in one corner of the room has bits of copper and metalworking tools strewn across it. Light filters in through the green, diamond-shaped panes of glass set into the window.
