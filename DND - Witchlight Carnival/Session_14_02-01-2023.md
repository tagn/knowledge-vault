## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We reconvene and recap what happened
- We make our way towards where Will is, see some more wanted posters along the way
- We walk up to a gigantic gnarled oak tree
	- A gigantic, gnarled oak comes into view. Unlike other oaks in the forest, this tree looks unhealthy and has golden brown leaves. A thick carpet of dead leaves surrounds it, and three rusty sickles lie among the leaves. Standing next to each of these weapons is a bleating goat.
	- Eight tiny houses made of woven twigs are nestled among the boughs of the tree. Squirrels dart nervously around these wee domiciles.
- Drayloch attempts to heal the tree, it doesnt seem to cause any change in apperance of the tree
- Fairies are in the trees, next to the sickles
- Amarylis, Zena, someone
- Granny Nightshade has a key protruding from her back that indicates her mood by how fast it turns. When she’s happy, the key turns quickly. When she’s upset, the key turns slowly. If she loses her temper, the key stops completely.
- Grandfather oak, fairies built their village on the tree, hags presence is sickening him
- We hear three tiny voices off to the side, one is named "Maple", they are pixies
- Reed Whistle -
- Starting to see multiple wanted posters ripped off
- We open the bag and the redcaps are barely clinging to life
- We enter a clearing where Will is
	- Up ahead, a small group of children frolics around a leafy oak tree, their gleeful yelps carrying through the forest. Painted swings dangle from the tree's branches. Nestled in its crown is a ramshackle treehouse.
	- The floor of the treehouse is covered with blankets, cushions, and piles of straw. Hanging from the six-foot-high ceiling by a rope is a basket that holds apples, berries, sugarcane, and a few crumpled-up sheets of parchment. In one corner, lying on a cushion, is a rusty oilcan that looks out of place. Heaped in another corner is a crude unicorn costume made of polka-dot quilts and a wooden horse's head that has a wooden horn attached to it.
- Young Elven Girl
- Dwarf
- Female Orc
- Dragon showed up when the hags showed up
- The three of us plus Starr, creep through the woods. Once we make it inside they will alarm the scarecrows
- Enter the goblin market posing as travellers, purchase sweets and go to meet the hag, during the meeting they'll do a distraction, all the tin soldiers would go into the courtyard
- Will climbs into the textile mill and saves the children or something
- We want to save 11 children apparently
-
