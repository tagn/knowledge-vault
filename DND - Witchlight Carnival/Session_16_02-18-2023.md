## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- Granny hears a noise after we mention having information about Will
- We fight mimic chairs
- Turdis licks a lollipop and gets real big
> Flickering lanterns illuminate a cluttered workshop filled with soft, ambient music produced by bells and chimes. Parts of toys are heaped on the tables- leering doll's heads, half-built rocking horses, unpainted wooden balls, and the stuffed limbs of soft toys. A stove at the back of the room holds a saucepan of smelting metal. Three doors exit the workshop, and two storefront windows overlook the market outside.
> Three young children are gathered around a wooden worktable. The eldest, a drow boy, prances on the tabletop with a bar of soap in one hand, while a halfling girl and a human girl giggle at his audacity.

- We encounter children in the workshop
- Pallomena - Halfling - Won't go anywhere without her piggy
- Sung - Wants 
- Nall - Wants to get out
- Kids in the sewing room, textile mill, sleeping area, kitchen
- Doll named pincushion has a key, its in the sewing room
- Kiddo has a replica of a key, but we poured the fucking pot of liquid metal onto the floor already
- Turdis barricades the door a bit and peeks out the window, he sees granny and two tin soldiers
> Ten brightly painted structures resembling little wooden houses line the walls of this room. Each small house has a three-foot-high hinged door. Four of the doors are open, and the other six are closed.
	A narrow staircase ascends the circular wall. Near the foot of the stairs is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
- Drayloch turns a crank on a jack in the box and probably TPKs us
