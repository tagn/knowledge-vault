	- "Bring this wisp of a thief to me alive and unharmed, and I'll ensure that no sword can ever break your skin."
	- "This rapscallion vexes me. Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll curse one creature whom you name."
	- "Special offer! Bring this impetuous brat to me, and you can claim one item of your choice from my workshop."
- Way off to the east I hear muffled singing
- Naisily annoying singing, sneaking up to the mushrooms
- Half circle of campistris are happily singing in a circle, surrounded by ugly toadstools, talking smack to anyone they can see.
