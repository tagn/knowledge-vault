## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We're tending to some sick kids in bed
- Will leads us to the staircase down towards the mushrooms
- > A woodland basin filled with plants and fungi stretches out along one side of the fallen tree. A pumpkin patch is at one end of the garden, next to a steaming compost heap, with ramshackle pens for pigs and goats at the opposite end. Bedraggled scarecrows hang from tall wooden stakes in the basin's wooded slope. Two ground-level doors and three balconies provide entry to the hag's lair.
- Gizzerk fell on a pumpkin and a snake came out
- Snake dead
- We alert some scarecrows and turdis throws fire at one
> 11 Butterfly Saddle. Each of these bright yellow toadstools has a ruffled, saddle-shaped cap properly sized for a pixie or sprite to sit on. They taste like butter and can be used as a substitute for that ingredient in recipes.

> 18 Eldercap. Eating one of these white and gray mushrooms causes the eater to look much older for 1 hour. This magical effect is an illusion that can be ended with a dispel magic spell.

> 19 Executioner’s Hood. Each of these mushrooms has a black, hood-shaped cap. Any creature that consumes an executioner’s hood must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death. This magical effect is identical to that of the feign death spell (including its duration).

> 16 Hummingbrella. A hummingbrella is a colorful mushroom with a frilly, parasol-shaped cap that drips sweet nectar and attracts hummingbirds. Eating one has the same effect as drinking antitoxin.

> 9 Pricklenoggin. Each of these mushrooms has short, prickly spines growing out of its red cap. Hats made from pricklenoggin caps are popular in the fey courts and considered very fashionable. Most tiny Fey would be grateful to receive one as a gift.
- Turdis and Drayloch pick mushrooms
- Gizzerk goes to get the pig out of the pen
- We see a compost heap and ignore it
- Phillamena gets her "piggy oink"
- We give the kid some mushroom to cure his shit, he starts to feel better
- Turdis tells Will to take the kids down to the workshop and wait for us to leave
- We go downstairs and enter the door midway down by gizzerk kicking it in

	"Dunderhead!" cries a scratchy voice as you enter this cluttered chamber. "Those tatty sleeves wouldn't serve as socks for a chicken. Start again!"

	A plump halfling boy and a young, fluffy bugbear sit at work benches, watched over by a living, childsized doll with buttons for eyes. An animated carpet prances around the children, who pay it no attention. The sewing room contains rolls of fabric, bobbins of thread, knitting needles, and pincushions.

- Gizzerk tries to talk the animated doll down after kicking in the door
- Elkhorn rushes up to help us
- Gizzerk falls into a fit of laughter
- We kill an animated doll and rug
- Release the kids
- Gizzerk gets some Dust of Corrosion
- Turdis collects some shit
- We discuss using the mechanical birds to send the painting but decide against it because Draylochs gods provide shitty guidance
>Creaking softly, a rocking horse moves back and forth near the door. Peeling paint covers its limbs, and its rocker is thick with moss. A rictus grin is painted on its face. Near a protruding root is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jackin-the-box.

- Turdis inserts the unicorn horn into the rocking horses head, changes into a gigantic white horse with a spot missing on its head
- "Thank you, thats not my horn, but it was enough to break the curse"
- Unicorn - named Eliodon - wants to see his wife at "the unicorn lake"
- We start walking away and Drayloch turns a crank
- Small green dragon pops out of the box
- We get away without the dragon coming to fuck us
- We get back to little oak - everybody is there except for Zennor
- Will makes food for the kiddos
-
