## Session Summary

This session starts with the groups arrival to the Pixie Kingdom. Drayloch, having triumphed atcupcake eating contest, told his new friends to continue without him while he rested, entering a trance while standing outside of the Pixie Kingdom. Gizzerk and Turdis proceeded to enter the Pixie Kingdom without him, seeking [[White Hare]] for more information on how to get into the [[Prismeer]].

Upon entering the Pixie Kingdom, the group encounters a Pixie, Gerry-Plum, sitting outside. For a stamp on their tickets, they were given potions which caused them to shrink down to a very small size so they may enter the Pixies miniature exhibit. They also recieved Pixie names to use while in the Pixie Kingdom, Gizzerk was to be known as "Cobweb", and Turdis was given the name "Cotton Candy".

After shrinking down, they noticed some Pixies drinking and having a good time, and a now gigantic pug named Pinecone that is giving rides. Gizzerk immediately showed a fascination with Pinecone and approached the dog attempting to get a ride. Unable to get the attention of Pinecone, they approached the group of Pixies to inquire about getting a ride on this dog. The Pixie they approached showed them the way to get up to the dog to hop onto its back, and they both proceeded to mount the animal for a ride around the Pixie Kingdom.

After a short but fun ride on the back of the gigantic pug, the two found themselves looking for refreshments after having vacated their bellies during the cupcake contest. They entered a small tent and were presented with various sandwiches and beverages. Still feeling the shame of the previous defeat to the tiny elf, the two proceeded a brief impromptu sandwich eating contest before noticing that [[White Hare]] had entered looking for them.

[[White Hare]] advised the adventurers they were making good progress towards getting crowned the Witchlight Monarch and that they should continue to do good deeds and bring joy to those in the Carnival. Gizzerk wished to become the Witchlight Monarch and Turdis agreed that efforts should be made to get Gizzerk crowned, as only one person could claim the title. During the conversation the group learned the name of one of the carnival owners, Mr. Light, that is the one they are trying to get attention of to get entry into the [[Prismeer]]. [[White Hare]] shared that his sister was frozen alongside [[Zybilna]] by the hags, and he needs our help to save her. He also informed the group that they would be sneaking into the Hall of Illusions that evening, but would be unable to get the portal open to the [[Prismeer]] unless they got a passcode, which is why they needed the help of the carnival owners.

Wanting to test the groups mettle, [[White Hare]] led them into a secret meadow, in which waited a group of giant animals ready to spar. After Gizzerk was nearly gored to death by the charge of a giant goat, the adventurers emerged victorious and were given a healing potion each by [[White Hare]]. The adventurers decided to continue around the carnival to see what else they could do.

Having been reminded of Drayloch's fascination with unicorns, Turdis had the idea to affix the unicorn horn he carried in his bag to Draylochs forehead as a surprise for when he awoke from his trance. Having gotten Gizzerk on board with this plan, the two purchased candy apples from a vendor to use the caramel as a sort of glue to stick the horn to Drayloch. The two quickly learned that they were unfit to complete such an ambitious plan when they both failed miserable to get the horn to stick to Drayloch. Gizzerk proceeded to make a crude attempt to clean off Drayloch without him waking as Turdis stuffed the caramel coated unicorn horn into Drayloch's bag.

The two then set off towards the snail racing event. This event let the adventurers don the mantle of "Snail Jockey" and enter a race to win a Potion of Advantage. Gizzerk scoped out the snails available to choose and found one, named Whizzy, that appealed to him. Turdis looked for the worst looking snail and ended up finding one that secreted a mucus that differed in color to the rest of the snails named Black Queen. After a very neck and neck race, Turdis claimed first place and was awarded the Potion of Advantage while Gizzerk claimed his prize of a wand that would allow him to cast dancing lights. After the race, Turdis approached the handler for Black Queen and  inquired about getting the attention of the carnival owners. He learned that they were likely in the staff area, but they would need a pass to get in or would have to get in trouble and taken in.

Gizzerk and Turdis then set off toward the Bubble-Pop teapot, stopping to check if any ants were trying to get at the caramel still smeared on Drayloch. In the teapot area, they were transported high up into the air inside of large bubbles. Gizzerk made a futile attempt to merge his bubble with the one carrying Turdis, but it was a bit more slippery than he thought and got nowhere. Turdis, seeing that the sun was setting and the carnival was becoming more dark, conjured a small flame in his hand to illuminate the bubble he was in with the hopes to cause a small spectacle for the carnival goers below.

After exiting from the tea pot area, the group decided to burn some time waiting for Drayloch to awaken by playing some carnival games.
