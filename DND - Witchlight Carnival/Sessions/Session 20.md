*When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, no one could enter her palace without an invitation. It's unlikely that the Hourglass Coven is capable of enforcing similar restrictions on the palace.
*A library on the second floor of the palace contains Zybilna's most treasured tomes.
*A dragon-like creature called a jabberwock lives in Zybilna's palace and frequently prowls the forest. The jabberwock tries to reach Wayward Pool but is always turned away by the lake's protective magic. Lamorna emphasizes that the characters would be wise to avoid the jabberwock, for once it sets its fiery eyes on prey, it rarely gives up the hunt.
