## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We discuss maybe a peaceful resolution when we get back to bavlorna, maybe confronting her about not being affected by the enchantment she placed on us
- We go into the lightning rod room and discuss maybe overloading it with lightning
- We go onto a balcony box seat thing for the theatre
- We discuss Gleam getting back in using the cupcake - she might be able to find us more easily
This cylindrical chamber houses a whirring contraption bolted to a revolving metal disk that serves as its base. Metal spheres and sickles are attached to the ends of long metal arms that sweep back and forth, clicking loudly and rhythmically like the hands of a giant metronome. The apparatus is inlaid with characters from strange alphabets, and smoky wisps in the shapes of these letters rise from the contraption as it revolves. The whole device hums and crackles with lightning.

Rising from the middle of the mechanism is an eighty-foot-tall copper pole made of eight ten-foot-long lightning rods attached end to end. It extends upward past a ring-shaped gallery that forms the chamber's upper level, through a hole in the fifty-foot-high domed ceiling.

Three goblins wearing overalls and tinted goggles use brooms to sweep the floor, seemingly untroubled by the noise.
Two stone balconies are fringed with thick drapes of musty velvet trimmed with black lace, and the black marble railings are decorated with leering alabaster masks. A large, square mirror set in the wall behind each balcony is flanked by wooden panels painted with thunderclouds and lightning bolts. An upholstered bench on each balcony faces a grand view of the stage and the stormy sky.
An open-air amphitheater is carved from the slope of the mountaintop. Short, cloaked figures sit on tiered stone benches, facing the stage. Enclosing the stage are ten-foot-high stone walls, above which you can see the stormy sky. A team of masked goblins is preparing the stage for a play while costumed actors huddle in the wings and recite lines. Lighting is provided by an intricate overhead contraption upon which several more masked goblins are perched. The sounds of chains clanking and gears turning can be heard coming from somewhere under the mountaintop.

- We walk back and check out the chairs
- This tower contains a sparsely furnished guest room attached to a stone balcony. The door connecting them swings back and forth in the wind.
- We find the cloud balloon merchants 
- AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY:
	Very good thimble (fingertip not included)
	Mug of Bumble Beer (has a nice sting to it)
	Duskmallow pie (with decorative bite marks)
	Bundle of dry wood (great for starting fires)
	Ink portraits (if we have to look at you, so should you)
	Moonlight monocle (no more fumbling in the dark)
- They want the rhythm of someones step or color from their iris to trade
- charm mentions some goblins might know about the blue orb
- Drayloch picks a lock upstairs, steps in and gets thrown off the balcony
- 
- Scores of wooden marionettes hang from the ceiling of this oddly shaped room, the floor of which is strewn with old play scripts. Near the entrance are two alcoves, one containing a bare table, the other holding a wooden chest with tiny, clawed feet. Deeper in the room, you see a wicker basket surrounded by miniature toy birds.

Scores of hourglasses are fixed to the walls. Whenever the sand of an hourglass runs out, the mechanism that attaches the hourglass to the wall causes it to flip over. The steady hiss of all those falling grains of sand can be heard throughout the room.

A large, glass-doored wardrobe with a jade eye embedded in its cornice stands on the far side of the room in a wide alcove.
- Turdis smashes the glass on the wardrobe and snatches the orb back
- We're "ambushed" by darklings trying to leave endolyns room
- Kill them and book it across the room to another hallway
- Bottles filled with crackling lightning line wooden bookcases along the walls of this chamber.

	An open archway leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the amphitheater forty feet below. On the opposite side of the room from the arch is a large wooden desk, atop which a stack of parchment flutters under a stone paperweight shaped like a toad. Scattered on the desk are ink pots and ink-stained quills. Dangling from a rafter near the desk is a rusty cage that holds three folded paper birds flitting about like moths.

- Drayloch investigates some paper on a balcony
	Dearest Skab,
	Mummy's little warlock spy was happy to betray her companions and reveal that Kelek, Zargash, and the others are conspiring to betray us. But fear not. Their plots will not succeed. Even now, an outside force promises to rid us of the whole stinking lot. What's important is that the Cauldron remain safe. Let me know how you wish to proceed.
	Your beloved sister,
	En
	Lord Kelek,
	I have written a new play titled The Agonies of Alagarthas. It's a tragic tale inspired by real-life misfortune that I think you might enjoy. You and the other members of the League of Malevolence are invited to Motherhorn to watch a live performance. Your missing colleague, Skylla, has been my guest for some time, but I'm afraid she has worn out her welcome. In exchange for my generosity, I'm hoping you can take her off my hands.
	Until our next meeting,
	Endelyn
	My darling Bav,
	Skab had the horn but either lost it or forgot where she hid it. Her head is so full of cobwebs. Imagine what she'll be like when she's senile.
	Your favorite sister,
	End
- Turdis kicks in the door of the other room
- We ring a bell and hop on some cranes to take off towards the palace of hearts desire
