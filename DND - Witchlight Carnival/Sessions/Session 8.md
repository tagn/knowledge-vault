## Session Summary

The group begins by boarding a skiff led by two Harengon ex-followers of Agdon on route to Downfall. They learn that Downfall is controlled by a Bullywog king. Shortly before arriving to downfall, the two harengon part ways. The group arrives to be greeted by multiple Bullywogs that welcome them, but immediately direct them to seek their King.

The group proceeds through downfall, stopping to attempt to help some bullywogs that are repairing a flying balloon, but are again instructed to seek out an audience with the king before doing anything there. They continue on and Dreyloch steps on the head of a stone golem while crossing a "bridge", but Turdis quickly apologizes to avoid a confrontation.

Then suddenly they approach a small hut that appears to be smoking. When getting closer, they find that the hut is currently assailed by some animated coal sprites, who are causing havoc and setting things ablaze. The bullywog inside of the hut pleads for assistance in putting out the fires so the group rushes in to help. After a brief confrontation the fires are extinguished and the Bullywog gives the group a brass brooch as a token of thanks. They are told that this should be presented when they have the audience with the King as a way to gain favor.

After being led out of this hut, they begin crossing a bridge and find multiple Bullywog heads stuck to stakes, all seeming to still be alive even though they are without their bodies. They learn that these Bullywogs are the previous "kings", of which each had lost their throne in some silly manner or had been struck down by the successive king. They showed some level of discontentment with the Hags, as since she has been in power they  have been unable to die. On this bridge the group also encounters Clapperclaw, whom was the one that Alleywick told them to seek out when getting to the Prismeer.

They learn that Clapperclaw also had something taken from him, his head, and he agrees to assist the group. The adventurers set off on their way to have an audience with the current Bullywog king...
