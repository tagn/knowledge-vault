## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We make our way up a spiral staircase and enter a circular chamber:
	- The walls of this circular chamber are decorated with sculpted reliefs depicting humans and demons partaking in grotesque revels. A spiral staircase with a golden handrail is in the middle of the room.
- We see a guy in the air, seemingly falling but frozen in time
- We realize we might have some casualties if we break the cauldron, as this guy seems like he'll just fall to his death
- We're heading to the secret library/vault
- We enter a hallway filled with doors, they seem to be bedrooms
	- We find a white room with a man sleeping in it, there is a rope that we think can eb used to call the servants
	- We find a green room with a forest gnome
	- We find a blue room with an open window, a line of blue birds motionless in the windowsill
		- Turdis attempts to unfreeze the birds by guessing random names
	- Gizzerk kicks in a door and finds a high elf, with seemingly a goblin servant
	- Rope in the blue room gets yanked on by Turdis, and snaps. No effect
	- Velvet black room, six goblins in the middle of cleaning
		- Turdis finds a broom handle and tries to reinforce the a precarious stack of chairs a goblin is standing on
- Drayloch approaches a door at the end of the hallway
	- The surface of this double door is sculpted to look like the head of a cat. As you approach, it purrs, "Why, hello there."
	- We talk the door into opening
- We walk into a ruined laboratory and Drayloch finds some bean pods that seem to be able to cast plant growth
- Turdis sees his home in the mirror
- Drayloch sees his pen writing on paper on a desk that appears to be within the castle somewhere
- We enter a room at the end of the hall with three bell jars resting on a table, it seems to have three visages of various characters. The one on the left side appears to be a younger version of Zybilna
- Turdis touches the table and they appear to shift into younger, current, and older versions of himself
- We ponder on the intentions of the hags, maybe we were brought here to help them get to the cauldron
- We find two half person/half lion people that are here from another realm looking into Zybilna
	- They are looking for confirmation that Zybilna is Iggwilv
	- They are looking for a copy of "The faceless ward"
- If we go back down the stairs down the tower, we'd end up in the ballroom which is where the cauldron is
- Turdis and Drayloch try to go pull on ropes to get Thinnings to come over - doesn't work
- We try to navigate around the tower more to get to the library by going back down the spiral stairs, then up stairs towards some tower something towards the middle
- We go into the main entrance, then to a tower to the west
- Turdis uses Stone Shape and opens a hole into a wall through to the "secret library"
- We find a bunch of books, then decide to take a long rest before proceeding. Drayloch will try to get more information about the books as we rest
