## Session Summary

The adventurers, having limited information on what to do, wanted to seek the [[White Hare]] to get more information on how to get back what they lost. They started by going to the dragonfly rides at the Carnival with the hopes that a higher vantage point would allow them to locate where the [[White Hare]] ran off to. Upon arriving at the ride they were greeted by a Treant and a Red Squirrel whom they were to get their ticket punched to get on the ride. Gizzerk mean-mugged the squirrel and the group noticed that this action caused a negative change in the environment.

After getting their tickets punched, they approached the ride and noticed a dwarf attempting to ride on a dragonfly that was out of control. The group noticed a Kenku nearby that was gesturing towards the dragonfly and muttering something to itself. Gizzerk aided the out of control beast while Drayloc and Turdis rushed towards the Kenku. After Drayloc commanded the Kenku to halt, a conversation occurred between the group and this individual. 

The group learned that the Kenku, [[Kettlesteam]], also had something taken from her. [[Kettlesteam]]
told the group that she was causing a ruckus to attempt to get the attention of the carnival owners.  [[Kettlesteam]] appeared to be wearing a necklace similar to the adventurers. She informed the group that [[White Hare]], [[Alleywick]], and herself were working together to try to get our group into the [[Prismeer]] to help them. We learned that the [[Hags]] were the ones that had taken what the adventurers had lost, and that [[Kettlesteam]] was unable to enter the [[Prismeer]] herself. The group also noticed that when [[Kettlesteam]] attempted to reveal certain pieces of information, she started coughing up a sappy substance, likely due to some curse placed on her. It seemed like these [[Hags]] did not want information on them to be spread easily.

After finishing the discussion, the group proceeded to get on the dragonfly ride and saw the [[White Hare]] leaving the Feasting Orchard, going towards the carousel, [[Kettlesteam]] was seen going towards the swan ride, and a number of individuals appearing to match the description of [[Alleywick]] were seen. The group then set off towards the carousel with the hopes of finding the [[White Hare]]. On the way to the carousel, Turdis revealed that he had a unicorn horn in his possession.

The adventurers did not find the [[White Hare]], but proceeded to ride the carousel anyways. The carousel was occupied by wooden unicorns that sprung to life. While on the ride, the unicorns whispered to each of the adventurers with information regarding the specific hag that each of them may need to encounter to get back what they had lost. 

The group then proceeded into the Feasting Orchard where they found a cupcake eatting contest was occurring, with the winner receiving an invisibility cupcake. The three adventurers competed, with Turdis and Gizzerk not having the iron stomaches they each believed that they had, with Drayloc claiming victory and receiving the cupcake as his prize.

Shamefully, (at least for Gizzerk and Turdis), the group left the contest and approached the individual they believed to be [[Alleywick]] whom was also at the Orchard and just witnessed this small elf crush two much larger individuals in an eating contest. 

[[Alleywick]] also was wearing a similar necklace to the group, but not entirely the same. Turdis cast Detect Magic to see if the necklaces were giving off any sort of magical effect and saw that [[Alleywick]]  was very much glowing with magical aura, likely meaning she possesses a lot of magic/magical items herself. Turdis also peered into his bag privated and saw the the unicorn horn had a faint magical glow.

[[Alleywick]] advised the group more about what was happening at the carnival and she was part of a group called the "Anti-Hourglass Coven", which seemed to consist of herself, [[White Hare]], and [[Kettlesteam]]. She also informed the group that in the [[Prismeer]], the Arch Fey [[Zybilna]] was frozen and they needed our help. The adventurers learned that a portal to the [[Prismeer]] could be opened inside of the Hall of Illusions, but we needed the help of the owners of the carnival to get it opened. While [[Kettlesteam]] attempted to get their attention by causing misdeeds, the group would try to claim the Crown of the Witchlight Monarch, which was told to be given to whomever caused the most joy during the carnival.

The group then set off to the Pixie Kingdom in search of the [[White Hare]] for more information.
