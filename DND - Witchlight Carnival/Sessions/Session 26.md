- Stagefright takes us towards creepy lyn
	- This cylindrical chamber houses a whirring contraption bolted to a revolving metal disk that serves as its base. Metal spheres and sickles are attached to the ends of long metal arms that sweep back and forth, clicking loudly and rhythmically like the hands of a giant metronome. The apparatus is inlaid with characters from strange alphabets, and smoky wisps in the shapes of these letters rise from the contraption as it revolves. The whole device hums and crackles with lightning.
		Rising from the middle of the mechanism is an eighty-foot-tall copper pole made of eight ten-foot-long lightning rods attached end to end. It extends upward past a ring-shaped gallery that forms the chamber's upper level, through a hole in the fifty-foot-high domed ceiling.
	
		Three goblins wearing overalls and tinted goggles use brooms to sweep the floor, seemingly untroubled by the noise.
- Hag reveals a puppet theater
- The walls of this chamber are jet black, with goldpainted scrollwork where the walls meet the ceiling and each other. Ornate, high-backed armchairs face a raised dais. An alcove at the back of the dais is half hidden by a black curtain.
- Draped in black robes, the hag peers down at you from her curtained alcove. Her long fingers twitch, and extra hands appear from within the folds of her ghastly dress. She gazes upon each of you in turn before saying, "Seekers of fate, you have come before the Dame of Unhappy Endings to glimpse your doom. Behold!"

The hag unveils a puppet theater that was hidden in her clothing. It includes stringed marionettes that resemble you and your companions. With each tug of the strings, the puppets bob around the stage, speaking in the hag's scratchy voice.

- gizzerk sees a puppet show about a dragonborn getting eaten by a dragon
- drayloch sees something that looks like gizzerk poisoning a drink and giving it to him
