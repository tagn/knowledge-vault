## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We come up to the entrance to a cave, statues that look like korreds are outside looking towards the entrance
- We leave some companions behind and enter the cave
- Tapping stops as soon as we enter the cave
- We take a left at a 3-way fork in the path
- Turdis, Gizzerk, and some other party members fall asleep magically while walking and hearing tapping
- Drayloch engages with some Brigganock, it gets away
- He runs into a human who seems to work with the Brigganocks, but conflicts with the information the korreds gave us
- Gizzerk tries to convince Molliver that the Brigganocks are buttholes, and the Koreeds are cool
- We follow Molliver through the cave towards the "entrance" to the hags lair
	- The route ends at a gaping chasm, on the far side of which is a grotto full of stalactites and stalagmites. A truss bridge constructed of intricate wooden struts and beams spans the one-hundred-foot gap across the chasm. Beneath the bridge is darkness dotted with purple lights.
	
	"Well," declares Molliver, "here we are at jolly old Rivenwish Chasm. Best stay on the bridge and not dillydally."
