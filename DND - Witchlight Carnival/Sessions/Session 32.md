- We talk to Steve for a bit, hes not super useful, we show him Elkhorns body
	- We get into a fight about the eyes, Turdis slaps gizzerk
- We go up towards the vault
	- The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are made of white marble tiles. In the middle of the room, a quill with a feather sheathed in flame and a black-covered book rest on an iron lectern.
	- We look through the names:
		- First name listed is Zybilna

		- We find names of the league of malevolence - We start scribbling out names every name except:
			- Our names

			- Zennor
- We go further upstairs
- An ornate iron door stands at the top of the staircase. Its surface is covered with a complex array of cogs, latches, and tumblers. The round doorknob is engraved with the image of a nightingale.
- Drayloch sees a series of locks on the door, he speaks "Natasha" to the door and it swings open
	- The door swings open to reveal a circular chamber illuminated by drifting balls of colored light. In the middle of the room, a finely forged greatsword floats, point upward, three feet above a treasure chest. The magic that holds the sword aloft also rotates it slowly, so that the blade catches and reflects the multicolored lights.
- Gizzerk gets a sentient greatsword that hates dragons
	- A ring of marble pillars sculpted with images of fairies and demons supports the arched ceiling of this circular chamber. Seven archways spaced evenly around the room's perimeter lead to empty turrets with tall, stained-glass windows set in their walls. Each window bears the image of a knight in armor.
	
		Near the middle of the room, a short, gray-bearded man in black robes reclines on a gilded wooden throne with clawed feet. The man grips the leashes of three small, scaly, birdlike creatures. A muscular, armored man stands next to the throne. He wears a helm that conceals his face except for his red, glowing eyes, and his sword he holds is wreathed in flames.
		
		A statue of an unarmored elf stands in front of the throne. The statue is posed as if ready for battle, with a shortsword gripped tightly in each of its hands.
- We mop the fucking floor with them
	- Gizzerk tries to check out the flaming sword
		- Sword is not currently on fire
	- Turdis has 3 charges left on his ring
