- Zybilna's Rules of Etiquette ALL whom disobey will be swiftly punished.

 
 • Rule of Hospitality. When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.

 • Rule of Ownership. You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn’t belong to you without the rightful owner’s permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.

 • Rule of Reciprocity. When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.

- Got into a fight with a group of harengon bandits who were chanting:
	>With sticks and stones, we’ll break your nose;
		We’ll beat you blind and steal your clothes.
		But none among us can compare
		To one wily, swift, and stand-up hare—
		Scarf that’s glorious, thief notorious,
		His deeds are truly meritorious!
		With a wink and a grin, he’ll show his cunning;
		A flash of his scarf, he’ll take off running.
		Quick as a bolt, his long scarf trailing,
		Gasping, grasping, you’ll end up flailing.
		You’ll pout, you’ll moan, you’ll huff, you’ll sneer;
		Thanks to Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer!
- Murdered the shit out of all of themt
- Befriended a giant snail that was in their company, naming it "Red Queen"
- Turdis turned into a snail to try to talk to the snail to no avail
- Gizzerk butchered the corpses of the harengon to eat
