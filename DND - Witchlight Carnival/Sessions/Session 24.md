## Session Summary

## Session Event Log

- We wake up, it seems the fellas had an adventure while I slept
- We can go down into the mountains or back up the path we came
- We go down the path to probably the shitty fucking place
- We see a path going down and we see tall, 200ft tall, beacons with braziers on top
- We avoid going to those for now, and head down the path that leads into a cave.
- Turdis buffs Gizzerk's weapon
- Gizzerk completes a game and stone hooved people, "koreeds" come out of the stones
- Endylyn uses metal sheers to make ropes out of some shits hair, might be made of iron
- *The brigganocks are helping Bitter End build wicked contraptions. They also hide and guard schematic diagrams for new contraptions in their mine. 
*The korreds can't stand the noise of the brigganocks' mining, so they craft statues and leave them outside the mine's entrance, hoping to frighten the brigganocks into leaving.
*A galeb duhr working for the korreds infiltrated the mine and overheard several brigganocks talking about a secret tunnel that connects the mine to Motherhorn. The tunnel is hidden by brigganock magic.

*The korreds no longer hold large gatherings at Lockbury Henge. Argantle fears the consequences of Bitter End's meddling and has instructed her fellow korreds to ensconce themselves in stone, thus remaining in relative safety for the foreseeable future.
*Bitter End used iron shears to cut off locks of Argantle's hair. The hag fashions korred hair into iron ropes and uses them to manipulate her theater's infernal contraptions.
*Bitter End uses a contraption called the Orrery of Tragedies to glimpse all possible futures. Copper rods on the mountaintops of Yon capture lightning and channel it into this device.
- We've earned the right, they are teaching us the special Jig, allows us to manipulate the korred hair to do different things
- Symbol of a moon made of copper on the lightning rod, its about 30 foot tall, 10 feet diameter. It shoots a lightning bolt toward Endylyn
- We pull it over through combined effort
- We come across the "dead ringers"
-
